Is programming required for penetration testing?

This is a common question asked by newcomers to the security community. Our opinion is that a formal programming education is not required, but a broad knowledge of programming languages is extremely helpful. Armed with this broad knowledge, we better understand software vulnerabilities and general operating system concepts.

This module will provide a theoretical approach to programming and Windows operating system concepts. It does not contain any exercises but does provide fundamental knowledge that we will rely on through this course.

## 2.1. Programming Theory

In the next few sections, we'll present a high-level overview of programming and introduce important terms.

### 2.1.1. Programming Language Level

Programming encompasses many concepts, categorizations and hierarchies. In this section we'll provide a general overview well-suited to penetration testing.

All programming languages are either _compiled_[1](https://portal.offsec.com/courses/pen-200-44065/learning/vulnerability-scanning-48659/wrapping-up-48703/wrapping-up-48710#fn-local_id_4797-1) or _interpreted_.[2](https://portal.offsec.com/courses/pen-200-44065/learning/vulnerability-scanning-48659/wrapping-up-48703/wrapping-up-48710#fn-local_id_4797-2) When using a compiled language, code must be converted to binary (compiled) before it can be executed. On the other hand, when using an interpreted language, code files (_scripts_) are parsed and converted into the required binary format one line at a time when executed.

The description above is not 100% accurate in relation to concepts as just-in-time compilation and optimization but that is normally not relevant for us as penetration testers.

In order to describe the hierarchy of programming languages we'll focus on compiled languages and begin with a discussion of the lowest-level languages.

Low-level programming languages are difficult for humans to understand, and are specifically tied to the hardware and contain a limited amount of features. On the other hand, high-level languages are easier for programmers to read and write, are more portable and provide access to greater complexity through the paradigm of _object-oriented programming_.[3](https://portal.offsec.com/courses/pen-200-44065/learning/vulnerability-scanning-48659/wrapping-up-48703/wrapping-up-48710#fn-local_id_4797-3)

At the very core, the CPU performs actions based on the _opcodes_[4](https://portal.offsec.com/courses/pen-200-44065/learning/vulnerability-scanning-48659/wrapping-up-48703/wrapping-up-48710#fn-local_id_4797-4) stemming from the compiled code. An opcode is a binary value which the CPU maps to a specific action. The set of opcodes can be translated to the low level _assembly_[5](https://portal.offsec.com/courses/pen-200-44065/learning/vulnerability-scanning-48659/wrapping-up-48703/wrapping-up-48710#fn-local_id_4797-5) programming language for better human readability.

When we deal with Windows or Linux computers we typically concern ourselves with the _x86 architecture_.[6](https://portal.offsec.com/courses/pen-200-44065/learning/vulnerability-scanning-48659/wrapping-up-48703/wrapping-up-48710#fn-local_id_4797-6) The architecture defines which opcodes are valid and what functionality they map to in assembly. The same thing applies to other CPU architectures like _ARM_[7](https://portal.offsec.com/courses/pen-200-44065/learning/vulnerability-scanning-48659/wrapping-up-48703/wrapping-up-48710#fn-local_id_4797-7) which is used with most smartphones and tablets.

Applications that require low overhead and high efficiency such as the core components of an operating system or a browser typically have elements written in assembly. Although we will not often write assembly code as penetration testers, it can be helpful to understand it in order to perform various bypasses of security products or perform more advanced attacks.

When we consider a language such as _C_,[8](https://portal.offsec.com/courses/pen-200-44065/learning/vulnerability-scanning-48659/wrapping-up-48703/wrapping-up-48710#fn-local_id_4797-8) we are using a more human-readable syntax, even though _C_ is still considered a relatively low-level language. By contrast, _C++_[9](https://portal.offsec.com/courses/pen-200-44065/learning/vulnerability-scanning-48659/wrapping-up-48703/wrapping-up-48710#fn-local_id_4797-9) can be considered as both high and low-level. It still provides access to all the features of C and accepts directly embedded assembly code through _inline assembly_[10](https://portal.offsec.com/courses/pen-200-44065/learning/vulnerability-scanning-48659/wrapping-up-48703/wrapping-up-48710#fn-local_id_4797-10) instructions. C++ also provides access to high-level features like classes and objects making it an object-oriented programming language.

Most scripting languages like _Python_, _JavaScript_ or _PowerShell_ are high-level languages and make use of the object-oriented programming model as well.

Code from lower level languages like C and C++ is converted to opcodes through the compilation process and executed directly by the CPU. Applications written in low-level languages must perform their own memory management, this is also referred to as unmanaged code.[11](https://portal.offsec.com/courses/pen-200-44065/learning/vulnerability-scanning-48659/wrapping-up-48703/wrapping-up-48710#fn-local_id_4797-11)

Languages like _Java_[12](https://portal.offsec.com/courses/pen-200-44065/learning/vulnerability-scanning-48659/wrapping-up-48703/wrapping-up-48710#fn-local_id_4797-12) and _C#_[13](https://portal.offsec.com/courses/pen-200-44065/learning/vulnerability-scanning-48659/wrapping-up-48703/wrapping-up-48710#fn-local_id_4797-13) are also object-oriented programming languages but are vastly different in how they are compiled and execute.

Code from Java and C# is compiled into _bytecode_[14](https://portal.offsec.com/courses/pen-200-44065/learning/vulnerability-scanning-48659/wrapping-up-48703/wrapping-up-48710#fn-local_id_4797-14) which is then processed by an installed virtual machine. Java uses the _Java Virtual Machine_ (_JVM_) which is part of the _Java Runtime Environment_ (_JRE_). C# uses the _Common Language Runtime_[15](https://portal.offsec.com/courses/pen-200-44065/learning/vulnerability-scanning-48659/wrapping-up-48703/wrapping-up-48710#fn-local_id_4797-15) (_CLR_), which is part of the _.NET_ framework.[16](https://portal.offsec.com/courses/pen-200-44065/learning/vulnerability-scanning-48659/wrapping-up-48703/wrapping-up-48710#fn-local_id_4797-16)

Web browsers typically execute code from scripting languages like JavaScript through a virtual machine as well. But when repetitive tasks are encountered a technique called _just-in-time_ (_JIT_) compilation[17](https://portal.offsec.com/courses/pen-200-44065/learning/vulnerability-scanning-48659/wrapping-up-48703/wrapping-up-48710#fn-local_id_4797-17) is employed where the script is compiled directly into native code.

Java's popularity largely stems from its operating system-independence, while C# has been primarily constrained to the Windows platform. With the relatively recent release of _.NET Core_[18](https://portal.offsec.com/courses/pen-200-44065/learning/vulnerability-scanning-48659/wrapping-up-48703/wrapping-up-48710#fn-local_id_4797-18) C# is also available on Linux or macOS.

When the bytecode is executed, the virtual machine compiles it into opcodes which the CPU executes.

When dealing with high-level languages, any code compiled into opcodes is often referred to as native code. Code produced by high-level languages that uses a virtual machine for execution is known as managed code.

In this scenario, a virtual machine will often provide memory management support that can help prevent security vulnerabilities such as buffer overflows.

Although it's not critical to be able to program in each of these languages, as penetration testers we should at least understand their differences and limitations.

### 2.1.2. Programming Concepts

In this section we'll discuss some basic concepts and terminology used in high-level language programming.

A key component of object-oriented programming is a _class_[1](https://portal.offsec.com/courses/pen-200-44065/learning/vulnerability-scanning-48659/wrapping-up-48703/wrapping-up-48710#fn-local_id_4798-1) which acts as a template for creating objects. Most classes contain a number of variables to store associated data and _methods_[2](https://portal.offsec.com/courses/pen-200-44065/learning/vulnerability-scanning-48659/wrapping-up-48703/wrapping-up-48710#fn-local_id_4798-2) that can perform actions on the variables.

In the Object-oriented paradigm, an object is _instantiated_[3](https://portal.offsec.com/courses/pen-200-44065/learning/vulnerability-scanning-48659/wrapping-up-48703/wrapping-up-48710#fn-local_id_4798-3) from its class through a special method called _constructor_.[4](https://portal.offsec.com/courses/pen-200-44065/learning/vulnerability-scanning-48659/wrapping-up-48703/wrapping-up-48710#fn-local_id_4798-4) Typically the constructor is named after its class and it's mostly used to setup and initialize the instance variables of a class.

For example, in the listing below, when a _MyClass_ object is instantiated, the _MyClass_ constructor will setup and initialize the _myNumber_ class variable to the value passed as a parameter to the constructor.

```
public class MyClass
{
    private int myNumber;

    // constructor
    public MyClass(int aNumber)
    {
        this.myNumber = aNumber;
    }
    
    public getNumber()
    {
      return myNumber;
    }
}
```

> Listing 1 - Class and constructor

As noted in Listing 1, the name of class, method and variables are pre-pended by an _access modifier_.[5](https://portal.offsec.com/courses/pen-200-44065/learning/vulnerability-scanning-48659/wrapping-up-48703/wrapping-up-48710#fn-local_id_4798-5) The two most common are _public_ and _private_. The _public_ modifier allows both code outside the class and inside the class to reference and use it, while _private_ only allows code inside the class to access it. The same concept applies for methods.

In Listing 1, all code can call the constructor _MyClass_, but only the instantiated object can reference the variable _myNumber_ directly. Code outside the object has to call the public method _getNumber_ to evaluate _myNumber_.

As we begin developing attack techniques and begin to write custom code, these concepts and terms will become increasingly more important. In addition, we'll rely on these concepts as we investigate and reverse-engineer high-level code.

## 2.2. Windows Concepts

Windows servers and workstations are ubiquitous in modern network environments. Let's take some time to discuss some basic Windows-specific concepts and terminology that we will use throughout multiple modules in this course.

### 2.2.1. Windows On Windows

Most Windows-based machines use the 64-bit version of the Windows operating system. However, many applications are still 32-bit.

To facilitate this, Microsoft introduced the concept of _Windows On Windows 64-bit_ (_WOW64_)[1](https://portal.offsec.com/courses/pen-200-44065/learning/vulnerability-scanning-48659/wrapping-up-48703/wrapping-up-48710#fn-local_id_4800-1) which allows a 64-bit version of Windows to execute 32-bit applications with almost no loss of efficiency.

Note that 64-bit Linux installations do not natively support 32-bit application execution.

WOW64 utilizes four 64-bit libraries (Ntdll.dll, Wow64.dll, Wow64Win.dll and Wow64Cpu.dll) to emulate the execution of 32-bit code and perform translations between the application and the kernel.

On 32-bit versions of Windows, most native Windows applications and libraries are stored in C:\Windows\System32. On 64-bit versions of Windows, 64-bit native programs and DLLs are stored in C:\Windows\System32 and 32-bit versions are stored in C:\Windows\SysWOW64.

As penetration testers, we must remain aware of the architecture or _bitness_ of our targets, since this dictates the type of shellcode and other compiled code that we can use.

(Microsoft, 2018), [https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/winprog64/wow64-implementation-details](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/winprog64/wow64-implementation-details) [↩︎](https://portal.offsec.com/courses/pen-200-44065/learning/vulnerability-scanning-48659/wrapping-up-48703/wrapping-up-48710#fnref-local_id_4800-1)

### 2.2.2. Win32 APIs

The Windows operating system, and its various applications are written in a variety of programming languages ranging from assembly to C# but many of those make use of the Windows-provided built-in _application programming interfaces_ (or _APIs_).

These interfaces, known as the _Win32 API_,[1](https://portal.offsec.com/courses/pen-200-44065/learning/vulnerability-scanning-48659/wrapping-up-48703/wrapping-up-48710#fn-local_id_4801-1) offer developers pre-built functionality. The APIs themselves are designed to be invoked from C and are documented with C-style data types but as we will discover throughout this course, they can be used with multiple other languages.

Many of the Win32 APIs are documented by Microsoft. One simple example is the _GetUserNameA_[2](https://portal.offsec.com/courses/pen-200-44065/learning/vulnerability-scanning-48659/wrapping-up-48703/wrapping-up-48710#fn-local_id_4801-2) API exported by Advapi32.dll which retrieves the name of the user executing the function.

The syntax section of the documentation shows the _function prototype_[3](https://portal.offsec.com/courses/pen-200-44065/learning/vulnerability-scanning-48659/wrapping-up-48703/wrapping-up-48710#fn-local_id_4801-3) that details the number and type of arguments along with the return type:

```
BOOL GetUserNameA(
  LPSTR   lpBuffer,
  LPDWORD pcbBuffer
);
```

> Listing 2 - Function prototype for GetUserNameA

In this example, the API requires two arguments. The first is an output buffer of type _LPSTR_ which is the Microsoft term for a character array. The second argument is a pointer to a _DWORD_ which is a 32-bit unsigned integer. The return value from the API is a boolean.

We will make extensive use of various Win32 APIs and their associated Microsoft data types[4](https://portal.offsec.com/courses/pen-200-44065/learning/vulnerability-scanning-48659/wrapping-up-48703/wrapping-up-48710#fn-local_id_4801-4) throughout this course. As we use these APIs we must keep in mind two particular details. First, we must determine if the process is 32-bit or 64-bit since some arguments and their size depend on the bitness. Second, we must distinguish between the use of _ASCII_[5](https://portal.offsec.com/courses/pen-200-44065/learning/vulnerability-scanning-48659/wrapping-up-48703/wrapping-up-48710#fn-local_id_4801-5) and _Unicode_[6](https://portal.offsec.com/courses/pen-200-44065/learning/vulnerability-scanning-48659/wrapping-up-48703/wrapping-up-48710#fn-local_id_4801-6) (which Microsoft sometimes refers to as _UTF-16_[7](https://portal.offsec.com/courses/pen-200-44065/learning/vulnerability-scanning-48659/wrapping-up-48703/wrapping-up-48710#fn-local_id_4801-7)). Since ASCII characters use one byte and Unicode uses at least two, many of the Win32 APIs are available in two distinct versions.

Listing 2 above shows the prototype for _GetUserNameA_, where the suffix "A" indicates the ASCII version of the API. Listing 3 below shows the prototype for _GetUserNameW_, in which the "W" suffix (for "wide char") indicates Unicode:

```
BOOL GetUserNameW(
  LPWSTR  lpBuffer,
  LPDWORD pcbBuffer
);
```

> Listing 3 - Function prototype

The first argument type is now of type _LPWSTR_ which is a UNICODE character array.

We will be using the Win32 APIs extensively in this course.

### 2.2.3. Windows Registry

Many programming languages support the concept of local and global variables, where local variables are limited in scope and global variables are usable anywhere in the code. An operating system needs global variables in much the same manner. Windows uses the _registry_[1](https://portal.offsec.com/courses/pen-200-44065/learning/vulnerability-scanning-48659/wrapping-up-48703/wrapping-up-48710#fn-local_id_4802-1) to store many of these.

In this section, we'll discuss the registry since it contains important information that can be abused during attacks, and some modifications may allow us to bypass specific defenses.

The registry is effectively a database that consists of a massive number of keys with associated values. These keys are sorted hierarchically using subkeys.

At the root, multiple _registry hives_[2](https://portal.offsec.com/courses/pen-200-44065/learning/vulnerability-scanning-48659/wrapping-up-48703/wrapping-up-48710#fn-local_id_4802-2) contain logical divisions of registry keys. Information related to the current user is stored in the _HKEY_CURRENT_USER_ (_HKCU_) hive, while information related to the operating system itself is stored in the _HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE_ (_HKLM_) hive.

The HKEY_CURRENT_USER hive is writable by the current user while modification of the HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE hive requires administrative privileges.

We can interface with the registry both programmatically through the Win32 APIs as well as through the GUI with tools like the Registry Editor (_regedit_) shown in Figure 1.

Figure 1 shows additional registry hives some of which we will explore in later modules.

Since a 64-bit version of Windows can execute 32-bit applications each registry hive contains a duplicate section called _Wow6432Node_[3](https://portal.offsec.com/courses/pen-200-44065/learning/vulnerability-scanning-48659/wrapping-up-48703/wrapping-up-48710#fn-local_id_4802-3) which stores the appropriate 32-bit settings.

The registry is used extensively by the operating system and a variety of applications. As penetration testers, we can obtain various reconnaissance information from it or modify it to improve attacks or perform evasion.

## 2.3. Wrapping Up

This module provided a brief introduction to programming and a high-level overview of some important aspects of the Windows operating system. This extremely brief overview serves to prepare us for the techniques we will use and develop in this course.
