# 13\. Phishing Basics

In this Learning Module, we will cover the following Learning Units:

-   Phishing 101
-   Payloads, Misdirection and Speedbumps
-   Hands-On Credential Phishing

Phishing involves both technical skills and social manipulation. Experts consider it a strategic and precise method used in cyberattacks.

Phishing attacks are categorized into two main types: **broad phishing** (mass attacks) and **spear phishing** (targeted attacks). A typical [_phishing campaign_](https://www.barracuda.com/support/glossary/phishing-campaign#:~:text=A%20phishing%20campaign%20is%20an,person%20in%20an%20email%20communication.) targets many people at once with generic messages designed for broad appeal.

In contrast, [_spear phishing_](https://www.ibm.com/topics/spear-phishing) targets specific individuals with personalized attacks, requiring detailed research. A spear phishing attack requires research into targets’ behaviors, preferences, and vulnerabilities to create convincing messages. This information is crucial for creating a convincing campaign and _pretext_ that the targets are likely to fall for.

Attackers now leverage [_Generative AI_](https://www.ibm.com/topics/generative-ai) (Gen AI) to improve social engineering tactics. By using AI-augmented technologies such as [_Large Language Models_](https://www.ibm.com/topics/large-language-models) (LLMs), process large amounts of public data to identify potential phishing targets. This approach helps attackers streamline the research process and personalize their attacks.

Attackers have also begun leveraging [Generative AI audio models](https://elevenlabs.io/blog/what-is-generative-ai-audio) to clone voices and generative video models to create [_deepfake_](https://www.techtarget.com/whatis/definition/deepfake) videos that convincingly replicate an individual’s facial expressions, movements, and voice patterns.

Cybercriminals use AI to make phishing harder to detect. This module teaches you how to spot and stop these threats.

In this Learning Module, we'll discuss the fundamental concepts behind a successful phishing campaign. We'll then construct and conduct our own phishing campaign in which we'll attempt to gain access to sensitive user credentials.

## 13.1. Phishing 101

This Learning Unit covers the following Learning Objectives:

-   Understanding Email Phishing
-   Exploring Smishing, Vishing, and Chatting
-   Enhancing Phishing through Social Engineering
-   Leveraging LLMs, Generative AI, and Deepfakes

Phishers have different goals: running malicious code or stealing login credentials. This objective determines the attack’s execution strategy.

Once attackers decide on an objective, they generally identify a communication method.

Email remains the most traditional and commonly used phishing medium. However, [_smishing_](https://www.ibm.com/think/topics/smishing) (SMS phishing), [_vishing_](https://www.cisco.com/site/us/en/learn/topics/security/what-is-vishing.html#:~:text=Vishing%2C%20short%20for%20voice%20phishing%2C%20refers%20to%20fraudulent%20phone%20calls,card%20numbers%2C%20or%20bank%20details.) (voice phishing), and deepfake-enhanced phishing attempts are becoming increasingly common. These methods can sometimes be combined for greater effectiveness.

This Learning Unit explains phishing approaches and how Generative AI enhances them.

## 13.1.1. Email Phishing

To better understand the social and technical mechanisms behind phishing campaigns, let's put together our own demonstration email phishing campaign.

The email text is often crafted with a particular goal, such as convincing the target to perform an action that will execute code. In this case, the attacker will likely include a malicious attachment in the email and persuade the target to open it, which triggers the execution of a specific payload. Malicious attachments can take different forms, including Office documents, PDFs, 7zip/zip archives, shortcut files, and calendar invites.

Attackers may embed a link that leads to an exploit-laden website. Clicking on these links can lead to the exploitation of vulnerabilities in specific browsers, enabling the attacker to run code on the target’s machine.

Alternatively, the email text might attempt to persuade the user to click a link which connects them to a malicious website which closely resembles a site the user often logs into. If the user logs in, the attacker gains possession of those credentials.

In phishing, a pretext is a fake story designed to convince someone to open a link or attachment. A successful attack relies on a believable [_pretext_](https://www.ibm.com/think/topics/pretexting). Small details matter—typos, bad grammar, and formatting mistakes can expose the scam. The pretext should be as believable and as seamless as possible to avoid raising suspicion.

This requires solid social engineering skills, a strong command of the target’s primary language, and details collected through research to add realism to the attack and convince the target to take the desired action.

Despite this information, crafting a convincing pretext remains complex. For example, our email must come from a familiar, or at least a seemingly benign source and we should align other email-based metadata with something the target might expect. For example, if we send an email from an unfamiliar domain, the recipient is less likely to open it and engage with it. To address this, attackers often purchase look-alike domains resembling the target’s organization, its vendors, or other familiar companies.

Along these lines, if an attacker gains access to a legitimate email account from the target's organization or one of the target's clients (perhaps by way of a public data breach or leaked credentials), they will use that account as it significantly improves their chances of success.

As for the pretext, it must align with the expectations of a target. If, for example, we're attempting to run a phishing campaign against the HR department of an organization, we should align our pretext with the kinds of emails an HR department is used to receiving. Getting this right takes some research, and often some working knowledge of the target's department and job roles.

It's also worth mentioning [_whaling_](https://www.ibm.com/topics/whale-phishing), a form of spear phishing that focuses on high-profile individuals. These targeted attacks require more care and attention than a typical phishing campaign. These pretexts are often highly customized and require significant research or inside knowledge of the target.

Info

When performing a phishing engagement for an organization, we will often receive a list of email addresses that we're not allowed to target. This list often includes high-profile individuals from the organization.

There are also very generic approaches we might take in phishing. One generic approach involves mimicking an email from a commonly used service like [_Slack_](https://slack.com/), [_Zoom_](https://zoom.us/), Google's [_Gmail_](https://mail.google.com/), or [_Microsoft Teams_](https://teams.microsoft.com/), which links to a cloned website which resembles that particular service. This is sometimes known as [_clone phishing_](https://www.proofpoint.com/uk/threat-reference/clone-phishing). This approach can be useful for large-scale phishing campaigns.

In summary, email-based phishing begins with extensive research into our target, and a solid objective. With our research and objective set, we can develop and furnish a pretext which will help achieve this objective. We then execute the phishing campaign, which synthesizes all the research and pretext work into a direct, technical campaign.

In the next section, we'll discuss other technologies we might want to consider when conducting a phishing campaign.

## 13.1.3. Smishing, Vishing, and Chatting

In addition to more-traditional email-based phishing campaigns, attackers can also leverage [_smishing_](https://www.ibm.com/topics/smishing) (a portmanteau of "SMS" and "phishing") to phish a target through SMS or other mobile messaging platforms.

SMS is a more personal and direct than email communication. The effectiveness of a smishing attack depends on the target. For example, a phishing message sent to a work phone should have a work-related context, while one sent to a personal phone would seem more authentic if it includes references to specific friends or family. In addition, since the target will not have the source phone number in their contact list, an attacker must add pretext to address this. These are crucial considerations when attempting to smish a target.

For example, in a popular ["CEO gift card scam"](https://2technical.co.uk/is-that-really-a-text-from-your-ceo-or-is-it-a-scam/), the attacker poses as a senior executive trying to send an employee a gift card. This could sway a target, especially if they believe the message came from a company executive.

Another category of phishing is voice phishing, sometimes called [_vishing_](https://www.fortinet.com/resources/cyberglossary/vishing-attack) This is a combination of ‘voice’ and ‘phishing, in which an attacker calls a target on the phone, and speaks to them directly. Traditional vishing relies more on social engineering skill rather than technical skill.

We can also use [caller ID spoofing techniques](https://usa.kaspersky.com/resource-center/preemptive-safety/phone-number-spoofing) in smishing and vishing campaigns to alter the sender or caller's source number. This has become more common because of the prevalence of Voice over Internet Protocol (VoIP) technologies.

In an adjacent style of social engineering attack known as [_SIM swapping_](https://www.natwest.com/fraud-and-security/fraud-guide/sim-swapping-scams.html), attackers call a mobile network provider and claim to be the owner of a specific mobile phone account. They then convince the network provider to transfer the phone number from the target's SIM card to a SIM card they control. This gives them control over the target's phone number, until the target is able to recover their access. This can of course be used for spoofing, but more critically, it is often used to bypass phone-based Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) protections.

As we wrap up this section, we should also highlight that chat and messaging applications are frequent phishing targets. This includes the popular [_Discord_](https://discord.com/), [_Slack_](https://slack.com/) and [Microsoft Teams](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-teams/group-chat-software) applications.

Regardless of the communication medium, attackers could adopt a broad, generic phishing approach against a broad range of targets or opt for a more precise attack against a smaller target base, depending on the overall objective.

## 13.1.4. Enhancing Phishing through Social Engineering

Now that we've briefly discussed a variety of social engineering techniques, let's discuss a few important foundational social engineering concepts and techniques that attackers typically wield in an attack.

Social engineering relies on psychological manipulation rather than technical expertise. This means attackers use more "human" judgment when deploying them, which is refined over time through some trial and error. Borrowing from this, as penetration testers, we want our phishing campaign to be as believable as possible, and adding some social engineering "spice" can introduce a little pressure which may encourage our targets to ignore their more sensible rational judgments.

Gaining the target's **trust** is the ultimate goal of any successful phishing campaign. We want our target to trust in our phish enough to entice them to follow through with what we are asking them to do. This requires we make a good impression. Put simply, our pretext must align with the target's expectations and avoid raising suspicion.

By extension, our pretext must align with our payload. For example, if our pretext suggests we are from a particular company, the landing page behind our malicious link must mirror that company's web page. The domain of the sending address and URL link must also pass at least a cursory inspection, which is why skilled phishers often purchase lookalike domain names. Minute details are also important, such as a TLS-enabled website since an insecure HTTP connection could raise suspicion. Carelessness can erode trust, so details matter.

But technical elements aren't the only factors in creating trust. We also need to use softer skills. For example, if we are impersonating a particular person (or even using their compromised email account) attempt to approximate that person's writing tone. We also want it to feel familiar and not raise suspicion. A more sophisticated tactic involves establishing rapport with the target before persuading them to open a malicious file or link.

Recognizing how to build trust (or how to exploit an existing trust relationship) is probably the most fundamental skill in successful phishing. However, there are other strategies we should consider in a phishing campaign.

_Urgency_ is a common social engineering technique used by phishers, manipulating targets into acting quickly without questioning the safety of the requested action or critically reflecting on what they're doing. Introducing a sense of urgency works best in organizations which have unhealthy work cultures. If a target often receives urgent requests and is expected to deliver on them without any critical thought, they are much more likely to fall for these kinds of manipulations.

Another strategy, _fear_, can cause a target to momentarily suspend their judgment, increasing the likelihood of compliance. _Authority_, a similar strategy to fear, can amplify the urgency of our request. This often involves taking on the role of a superior, or even the company's CEO. These strategies must be balanced as we consider elements of trust and the benefits of creating a good rapport.

Finally, we'll often leverage a positive incentive like a _reward_, in a process known as _baiting_ in which we offer something tangible to lure a target into performing an action. The promise might include a gift card, cash, or another incentive or intangible benefits like gaining favor with a superior. Offering something tangible in exchange for participation in something like a survey is not an uncommon approach for companies in general. This kind of approach might blend into the background noise for some targets.

The social elements of a phish directly correlate to the success rate of the campaign. Exploiting a trust relationship, and possibly adding other kinds of manipulations along the way, can help a target suspend their judgment, which can improve the effectiveness of a phishing campaign.

## 13.1.5. LLMs, Generative AI and Deepfakes

The introduction of [_Large Language Models_](https://www.ibm.com/topics/large-language-models) (LLMs) and [_Generative AI_](https://www.ibm.com/topics/generative-ai) (Gen AI) technologies present new opportunities for phishing and social engineering. Gen AI technologies are also particularly useful in research and LLMs in particular can advance the development of a pretext.

Some threat intelligence groups have noted the use of Gen AI in real-world phishing campaigns. For example, in 2023, [Microsoft warned of an uptick in the use of LLMs in crafting phishing emails](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365-life-hacks/privacy-and-safety/how-ai-changing-phishing-scams). Mandiant's [2024 M-Trends report](https://cloud.google.com/security/resources/m-trends) noted the rising use of [Gen AI in social engineering and information operations](https://cloud.google.com/blog/topics/threat-intelligence/threat-actors-generative-ai-limited).

However, these groups can only report on observable activity. For example, they cannot determine how end users leverage Gen AI in the planning and research stages of a phishing attack. LLMs in particular can collect relevant information about a target, as well as generate text for use in emails and websites. For example, an LLM could assist with [_Retrieval Augmented Generation_](https://cloud.google.com/use-cases/retrieval-augmented-generation) (RAG) to process a large amount of publicly-available information about a target, and distill this into material we can turn into a solid pretext. RAG may not even be necessary against high-profile targets, as the model may already have useful information. By creatively leveraging Gen AI, attackers can craft more personalized and convincing attacks.

In addition, technologies such as [_voice cloning_](https://elevenlabs.io/voice-cloning) have become much more available to the general public in recent years. These technologies allow attackers to create a voice model for an individual, based on a relatively small amount of recorded audio. They can then make this model say whatever they want. As Gen AI has become more available, the capabilities of voice cloning have become more advanced, and much harder to detect.

Deepfake videos are also being used in phishing attacks. In 2024, Architecture firm Arup fell prey [to a deepfake video scam](https://edition.cnn.com/2024/05/16/tech/arup-deepfake-scam-loss-hong-kong-intl-hnk/index.html). During a video call, deepfake clones of the CFO and other staff appeared and acted as actual employees. The deepfaked CFO signed off on a transfer of $25 million, which was then transferred to the attackers.

As Gen AI technologies become more advanced, we can leverage them as penetration testers to complement traditional phishing techniques.

A typical [_phishing campaign_](https://www.barracuda.com/support/glossary/phishing-campaign#:~:text=A%20phishing%20campaign%20is%20an,person%20in%20an%20email%20communication.) targets many people at once with generic messages designed for broad appeal.

In contrast, [_spear phishing_](https://www.ibm.com/topics/spear-phishing) targets specific individuals with personalized attacks, requiring detailed research. A spear phishing attack requires research into targets’ behaviors, preferences, and vulnerabilities to create convincing messages. This information is crucial for creating a convincing campaign and _pretext_ that the targets are likely to fall for.

Attackers now leverage [_Generative AI_](https://www.ibm.com/topics/generative-ai) (Gen AI) to improve social engineering tactics. By using AI-augmented technologies such as [_Large Language Models_](https://www.ibm.com/topics/large-language-models) (LLMs), process large amounts of public data to identify potential phishing targets. This approach helps attackers streamline the research process and personalize their attacks.

Attackers have also begun leveraging [Generative AI audio models](https://elevenlabs.io/blog/what-is-generative-ai-audio) to clone voices and generative video models to create [_deepfake_](https://www.techtarget.com/whatis/definition/deepfake) videos that convincingly replicate an individual’s facial expressions, movements, and voice patterns.

Cybercriminals use AI to make phishing harder to detect. This module teaches you how to spot and stop these threats.

In this Learning Module, we'll discuss the fundamental concepts behind a successful phishing campaign. We'll then construct and conduct our own phishing campaign in which we'll attempt to gain access to sensitive user credentials.

## 13.1. Phishing 101

This Learning Unit covers the following Learning Objectives:

-   Understanding Email Phishing
-   Exploring Smishing, Vishing, and Chatting
-   Enhancing Phishing through Social Engineering
-   Leveraging LLMs, Generative AI, and Deepfakes

Phishers have different goals: running malicious code or stealing login credentials. This objective determines the attack’s execution strategy.

Once attackers decide on an objective, they generally identify a communication method.

Email remains the most traditional and commonly used phishing medium. However, [_smishing_](https://www.ibm.com/think/topics/smishing) (SMS phishing), [_vishing_](https://www.cisco.com/site/us/en/learn/topics/security/what-is-vishing.html#:~:text=Vishing%2C%20short%20for%20voice%20phishing%2C%20refers%20to%20fraudulent%20phone%20calls,card%20numbers%2C%20or%20bank%20details.) (voice phishing), and deepfake-enhanced phishing attempts are becoming increasingly common. These methods can sometimes be combined for greater effectiveness.

This Learning Unit explains phishing approaches and how Generative AI enhances them.

## 13.1.1. Email Phishing

To better understand the social and technical mechanisms behind phishing campaigns, let's put together our own demonstration email phishing campaign.

The email text is often crafted with a particular goal, such as convincing the target to perform an action that will execute code. In this case, the attacker will likely include a malicious attachment in the email and persuade the target to open it, which triggers the execution of a specific payload. Malicious attachments can take different forms, including Office documents, PDFs, 7zip/zip archives, shortcut files, and calendar invites.

Attackers may embed a link that leads to an exploit-laden website. Clicking on these links can lead to the exploitation of vulnerabilities in specific browsers, enabling the attacker to run code on the target’s machine.

Alternatively, the email text might attempt to persuade the user to click a link which connects them to a malicious website which closely resembles a site the user often logs into. If the user logs in, the attacker gains possession of those credentials.

In phishing, a pretext is a fake story designed to convince someone to open a link or attachment. A successful attack relies on a believable [_pretext_](https://www.ibm.com/think/topics/pretexting). Small details matter—typos, bad grammar, and formatting mistakes can expose the scam. The pretext should be as believable and as seamless as possible to avoid raising suspicion.

This requires solid social engineering skills, a strong command of the target’s primary language, and details collected through research to add realism to the attack and convince the target to take the desired action.

Despite this information, crafting a convincing pretext remains complex. For example, our email must come from a familiar, or at least a seemingly benign source and we should align other email-based metadata with something the target might expect. For example, if we send an email from an unfamiliar domain, the recipient is less likely to open it and engage with it. To address this, attackers often purchase look-alike domains resembling the target’s organization, its vendors, or other familiar companies.

Along these lines, if an attacker gains access to a legitimate email account from the target's organization or one of the target's clients (perhaps by way of a public data breach or leaked credentials), they will use that account as it significantly improves their chances of success.

As for the pretext, it must align with the expectations of a target. If, for example, we're attempting to run a phishing campaign against the HR department of an organization, we should align our pretext with the kinds of emails an HR department is used to receiving. Getting this right takes some research, and often some working knowledge of the target's department and job roles.

It's also worth mentioning [_whaling_](https://www.ibm.com/topics/whale-phishing), a form of spear phishing that focuses on high-profile individuals. These targeted attacks require more care and attention than a typical phishing campaign. These pretexts are often highly customized and require significant research or inside knowledge of the target.

Info

When performing a phishing engagement for an organization, we will often receive a list of email addresses that we're not allowed to target. This list often includes high-profile individuals from the organization.

There are also very generic approaches we might take in phishing. One generic approach involves mimicking an email from a commonly used service like [_Slack_](https://slack.com/), [_Zoom_](https://zoom.us/), Google's [_Gmail_](https://mail.google.com/), or [_Microsoft Teams_](https://teams.microsoft.com/), which links to a cloned website which resembles that particular service. This is sometimes known as [_clone phishing_](https://www.proofpoint.com/uk/threat-reference/clone-phishing). This approach can be useful for large-scale phishing campaigns.

In summary, email-based phishing begins with extensive research into our target, and a solid objective. With our research and objective set, we can develop and furnish a pretext which will help achieve this objective. We then execute the phishing campaign, which synthesizes all the research and pretext work into a direct, technical campaign.

In the next section, we'll discuss other technologies we might want to consider when conducting a phishing campaign.

## 13.1.3. Smishing, Vishing, and Chatting

In addition to more-traditional email-based phishing campaigns, attackers can also leverage [_smishing_](https://www.ibm.com/topics/smishing) (a portmanteau of "SMS" and "phishing") to phish a target through SMS or other mobile messaging platforms.

SMS is a more personal and direct than email communication. The effectiveness of a smishing attack depends on the target. For example, a phishing message sent to a work phone should have a work-related context, while one sent to a personal phone would seem more authentic if it includes references to specific friends or family. In addition, since the target will not have the source phone number in their contact list, an attacker must add pretext to address this. These are crucial considerations when attempting to smish a target.

For example, in a popular ["CEO gift card scam"](https://2technical.co.uk/is-that-really-a-text-from-your-ceo-or-is-it-a-scam/), the attacker poses as a senior executive trying to send an employee a gift card. This could sway a target, especially if they believe the message came from a company executive.

Another category of phishing is voice phishing, sometimes called [_vishing_](https://www.fortinet.com/resources/cyberglossary/vishing-attack) This is a combination of ‘voice’ and ‘phishing, in which an attacker calls a target on the phone, and speaks to them directly. Traditional vishing relies more on social engineering skill rather than technical skill.

We can also use [caller ID spoofing techniques](https://usa.kaspersky.com/resource-center/preemptive-safety/phone-number-spoofing) in smishing and vishing campaigns to alter the sender or caller's source number. This has become more common because of the prevalence of Voice over Internet Protocol (VoIP) technologies.

In an adjacent style of social engineering attack known as [_SIM swapping_](https://www.natwest.com/fraud-and-security/fraud-guide/sim-swapping-scams.html), attackers call a mobile network provider and claim to be the owner of a specific mobile phone account. They then convince the network provider to transfer the phone number from the target's SIM card to a SIM card they control. This gives them control over the target's phone number, until the target is able to recover their access. This can of course be used for spoofing, but more critically, it is often used to bypass phone-based Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) protections.

As we wrap up this section, we should also highlight that chat and messaging applications are frequent phishing targets. This includes the popular [_Discord_](https://discord.com/), [_Slack_](https://slack.com/) and [Microsoft Teams](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-teams/group-chat-software) applications.

Regardless of the communication medium, attackers could adopt a broad, generic phishing approach against a broad range of targets or opt for a more precise attack against a smaller target base, depending on the overall objective.

## 13.1.4. Enhancing Phishing through Social Engineering

Now that we've briefly discussed a variety of social engineering techniques, let's discuss a few important foundational social engineering concepts and techniques that attackers typically wield in an attack.

Social engineering relies on psychological manipulation rather than technical expertise. This means attackers use more "human" judgment when deploying them, which is refined over time through some trial and error. Borrowing from this, as penetration testers, we want our phishing campaign to be as believable as possible, and adding some social engineering "spice" can introduce a little pressure which may encourage our targets to ignore their more sensible rational judgments.

Gaining the target's **trust** is the ultimate goal of any successful phishing campaign. We want our target to trust in our phish enough to entice them to follow through with what we are asking them to do. This requires we make a good impression. Put simply, our pretext must align with the target's expectations and avoid raising suspicion.

By extension, our pretext must align with our payload. For example, if our pretext suggests we are from a particular company, the landing page behind our malicious link must mirror that company's web page. The domain of the sending address and URL link must also pass at least a cursory inspection, which is why skilled phishers often purchase lookalike domain names. Minute details are also important, such as a TLS-enabled website since an insecure HTTP connection could raise suspicion. Carelessness can erode trust, so details matter.

But technical elements aren't the only factors in creating trust. We also need to use softer skills. For example, if we are impersonating a particular person (or even using their compromised email account) attempt to approximate that person's writing tone. We also want it to feel familiar and not raise suspicion. A more sophisticated tactic involves establishing rapport with the target before persuading them to open a malicious file or link.

Recognizing how to build trust (or how to exploit an existing trust relationship) is probably the most fundamental skill in successful phishing. However, there are other strategies we should consider in a phishing campaign.

_Urgency_ is a common social engineering technique used by phishers, manipulating targets into acting quickly without questioning the safety of the requested action or critically reflecting on what they're doing. Introducing a sense of urgency works best in organizations which have unhealthy work cultures. If a target often receives urgent requests and is expected to deliver on them without any critical thought, they are much more likely to fall for these kinds of manipulations.

Another strategy, _fear_, can cause a target to momentarily suspend their judgment, increasing the likelihood of compliance. _Authority_, a similar strategy to fear, can amplify the urgency of our request. This often involves taking on the role of a superior, or even the company's CEO. These strategies must be balanced as we consider elements of trust and the benefits of creating a good rapport.

Finally, we'll often leverage a positive incentive like a _reward_, in a process known as _baiting_ in which we offer something tangible to lure a target into performing an action. The promise might include a gift card, cash, or another incentive or intangible benefits like gaining favor with a superior. Offering something tangible in exchange for participation in something like a survey is not an uncommon approach for companies in general. This kind of approach might blend into the background noise for some targets.

The social elements of a phish directly correlate to the success rate of the campaign. Exploiting a trust relationship, and possibly adding other kinds of manipulations along the way, can help a target suspend their judgment, which can improve the effectiveness of a phishing campaign.

## 13.1.5. LLMs, Generative AI and Deepfakes

The introduction of [_Large Language Models_](https://www.ibm.com/topics/large-language-models) (LLMs) and [_Generative AI_](https://www.ibm.com/topics/generative-ai) (Gen AI) technologies present new opportunities for phishing and social engineering. Gen AI technologies are also particularly useful in research and LLMs in particular can advance the development of a pretext.

Some threat intelligence groups have noted the use of Gen AI in real-world phishing campaigns. For example, in 2023, [Microsoft warned of an uptick in the use of LLMs in crafting phishing emails](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365-life-hacks/privacy-and-safety/how-ai-changing-phishing-scams). Mandiant's [2024 M-Trends report](https://cloud.google.com/security/resources/m-trends) noted the rising use of [Gen AI in social engineering and information operations](https://cloud.google.com/blog/topics/threat-intelligence/threat-actors-generative-ai-limited).

However, these groups can only report on observable activity. For example, they cannot determine how end users leverage Gen AI in the planning and research stages of a phishing attack. LLMs in particular can collect relevant information about a target, as well as generate text for use in emails and websites. For example, an LLM could assist with [_Retrieval Augmented Generation_](https://cloud.google.com/use-cases/retrieval-augmented-generation) (RAG) to process a large amount of publicly-available information about a target, and distill this into material we can turn into a solid pretext. RAG may not even be necessary against high-profile targets, as the model may already have useful information. By creatively leveraging Gen AI, attackers can craft more personalized and convincing attacks.

In addition, technologies such as [_voice cloning_](https://elevenlabs.io/voice-cloning) have become much more available to the general public in recent years. These technologies allow attackers to create a voice model for an individual, based on a relatively small amount of recorded audio. They can then make this model say whatever they want. As Gen AI has become more available, the capabilities of voice cloning have become more advanced, and much harder to detect.

Deepfake videos are also being used in phishing attacks. In 2024, Architecture firm Arup fell prey [to a deepfake video scam](https://edition.cnn.com/2024/05/16/tech/arup-deepfake-scam-loss-hong-kong-intl-hnk/index.html). During a video call, deepfake clones of the CFO and other staff appeared and acted as actual employees. The deepfaked CFO signed off on a transfer of $25 million, which was then transferred to the attackers.

As Gen AI technologies become more advanced, we can leverage them as penetration testers to complement traditional phishing techniques.

A typical [_phishing campaign_](https://www.barracuda.com/support/glossary/phishing-campaign#:~:text=A%20phishing%20campaign%20is%20an,person%20in%20an%20email%20communication.) targets many people at once with generic messages designed for broad appeal.

In contrast, [_spear phishing_](https://www.ibm.com/topics/spear-phishing) targets specific individuals with personalized attacks, requiring detailed research. A spear phishing attack requires research into targets’ behaviors, preferences, and vulnerabilities to create convincing messages. This information is crucial for creating a convincing campaign and _pretext_ that the targets are likely to fall for.

Attackers now leverage [_Generative AI_](https://www.ibm.com/topics/generative-ai) (Gen AI) to improve social engineering tactics. By using AI-augmented technologies such as [_Large Language Models_](https://www.ibm.com/topics/large-language-models) (LLMs), process large amounts of public data to identify potential phishing targets. This approach helps attackers streamline the research process and personalize their attacks.

Attackers have also begun leveraging [Generative AI audio models](https://elevenlabs.io/blog/what-is-generative-ai-audio) to clone voices and generative video models to create [_deepfake_](https://www.techtarget.com/whatis/definition/deepfake) videos that convincingly replicate an individual’s facial expressions, movements, and voice patterns.

Cybercriminals use AI to make phishing harder to detect. This module teaches you how to spot and stop these threats.

In this Learning Module, we'll discuss the fundamental concepts behind a successful phishing campaign. We'll then construct and conduct our own phishing campaign in which we'll attempt to gain access to sensitive user credentials.

## 13.1. Phishing 101

This Learning Unit covers the following Learning Objectives:

-   Understanding Email Phishing
-   Exploring Smishing, Vishing, and Chatting
-   Enhancing Phishing through Social Engineering
-   Leveraging LLMs, Generative AI, and Deepfakes

Phishers have different goals: running malicious code or stealing login credentials. This objective determines the attack’s execution strategy.

Once attackers decide on an objective, they generally identify a communication method.

Email remains the most traditional and commonly used phishing medium. However, [_smishing_](https://www.ibm.com/think/topics/smishing) (SMS phishing), [_vishing_](https://www.cisco.com/site/us/en/learn/topics/security/what-is-vishing.html#:~:text=Vishing%2C%20short%20for%20voice%20phishing%2C%20refers%20to%20fraudulent%20phone%20calls,card%20numbers%2C%20or%20bank%20details.) (voice phishing), and deepfake-enhanced phishing attempts are becoming increasingly common. These methods can sometimes be combined for greater effectiveness.

This Learning Unit explains phishing approaches and how Generative AI enhances them.

## 13.1.1. Email Phishing

To better understand the social and technical mechanisms behind phishing campaigns, let's put together our own demonstration email phishing campaign.

The email text is often crafted with a particular goal, such as convincing the target to perform an action that will execute code. In this case, the attacker will likely include a malicious attachment in the email and persuade the target to open it, which triggers the execution of a specific payload. Malicious attachments can take different forms, including Office documents, PDFs, 7zip/zip archives, shortcut files, and calendar invites.

Attackers may embed a link that leads to an exploit-laden website. Clicking on these links can lead to the exploitation of vulnerabilities in specific browsers, enabling the attacker to run code on the target’s machine.

Alternatively, the email text might attempt to persuade the user to click a link which connects them to a malicious website which closely resembles a site the user often logs into. If the user logs in, the attacker gains possession of those credentials.

In phishing, a pretext is a fake story designed to convince someone to open a link or attachment. A successful attack relies on a believable [_pretext_](https://www.ibm.com/think/topics/pretexting). Small details matter—typos, bad grammar, and formatting mistakes can expose the scam. The pretext should be as believable and as seamless as possible to avoid raising suspicion.

This requires solid social engineering skills, a strong command of the target’s primary language, and details collected through research to add realism to the attack and convince the target to take the desired action.

Despite this information, crafting a convincing pretext remains complex. For example, our email must come from a familiar, or at least a seemingly benign source and we should align other email-based metadata with something the target might expect. For example, if we send an email from an unfamiliar domain, the recipient is less likely to open it and engage with it. To address this, attackers often purchase look-alike domains resembling the target’s organization, its vendors, or other familiar companies.

Along these lines, if an attacker gains access to a legitimate email account from the target's organization or one of the target's clients (perhaps by way of a public data breach or leaked credentials), they will use that account as it significantly improves their chances of success.

As for the pretext, it must align with the expectations of a target. If, for example, we're attempting to run a phishing campaign against the HR department of an organization, we should align our pretext with the kinds of emails an HR department is used to receiving. Getting this right takes some research, and often some working knowledge of the target's department and job roles.

It's also worth mentioning [_whaling_](https://www.ibm.com/topics/whale-phishing), a form of spear phishing that focuses on high-profile individuals. These targeted attacks require more care and attention than a typical phishing campaign. These pretexts are often highly customized and require significant research or inside knowledge of the target.

Info

When performing a phishing engagement for an organization, we will often receive a list of email addresses that we're not allowed to target. This list often includes high-profile individuals from the organization.

There are also very generic approaches we might take in phishing. One generic approach involves mimicking an email from a commonly used service like [_Slack_](https://slack.com/), [_Zoom_](https://zoom.us/), Google's [_Gmail_](https://mail.google.com/), or [_Microsoft Teams_](https://teams.microsoft.com/), which links to a cloned website which resembles that particular service. This is sometimes known as [_clone phishing_](https://www.proofpoint.com/uk/threat-reference/clone-phishing). This approach can be useful for large-scale phishing campaigns.

In summary, email-based phishing begins with extensive research into our target, and a solid objective. With our research and objective set, we can develop and furnish a pretext which will help achieve this objective. We then execute the phishing campaign, which synthesizes all the research and pretext work into a direct, technical campaign.

In the next section, we'll discuss other technologies we might want to consider when conducting a phishing campaign.

## 13.1.3. Smishing, Vishing, and Chatting

In addition to more-traditional email-based phishing campaigns, attackers can also leverage [_smishing_](https://www.ibm.com/topics/smishing) (a portmanteau of "SMS" and "phishing") to phish a target through SMS or other mobile messaging platforms.

SMS is a more personal and direct than email communication. The effectiveness of a smishing attack depends on the target. For example, a phishing message sent to a work phone should have a work-related context, while one sent to a personal phone would seem more authentic if it includes references to specific friends or family. In addition, since the target will not have the source phone number in their contact list, an attacker must add pretext to address this. These are crucial considerations when attempting to smish a target.

For example, in a popular ["CEO gift card scam"](https://2technical.co.uk/is-that-really-a-text-from-your-ceo-or-is-it-a-scam/), the attacker poses as a senior executive trying to send an employee a gift card. This could sway a target, especially if they believe the message came from a company executive.

Another category of phishing is voice phishing, sometimes called [_vishing_](https://www.fortinet.com/resources/cyberglossary/vishing-attack) This is a combination of ‘voice’ and ‘phishing, in which an attacker calls a target on the phone, and speaks to them directly. Traditional vishing relies more on social engineering skill rather than technical skill.

We can also use [caller ID spoofing techniques](https://usa.kaspersky.com/resource-center/preemptive-safety/phone-number-spoofing) in smishing and vishing campaigns to alter the sender or caller's source number. This has become more common because of the prevalence of Voice over Internet Protocol (VoIP) technologies.

In an adjacent style of social engineering attack known as [_SIM swapping_](https://www.natwest.com/fraud-and-security/fraud-guide/sim-swapping-scams.html), attackers call a mobile network provider and claim to be the owner of a specific mobile phone account. They then convince the network provider to transfer the phone number from the target's SIM card to a SIM card they control. This gives them control over the target's phone number, until the target is able to recover their access. This can of course be used for spoofing, but more critically, it is often used to bypass phone-based Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) protections.

As we wrap up this section, we should also highlight that chat and messaging applications are frequent phishing targets. This includes the popular [_Discord_](https://discord.com/), [_Slack_](https://slack.com/) and [Microsoft Teams](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-teams/group-chat-software) applications.

Regardless of the communication medium, attackers could adopt a broad, generic phishing approach against a broad range of targets or opt for a more precise attack against a smaller target base, depending on the overall objective.

## 13.1.4. Enhancing Phishing through Social Engineering

Now that we've briefly discussed a variety of social engineering techniques, let's discuss a few important foundational social engineering concepts and techniques that attackers typically wield in an attack.

Social engineering relies on psychological manipulation rather than technical expertise. This means attackers use more "human" judgment when deploying them, which is refined over time through some trial and error. Borrowing from this, as penetration testers, we want our phishing campaign to be as believable as possible, and adding some social engineering "spice" can introduce a little pressure which may encourage our targets to ignore their more sensible rational judgments.

Gaining the target's **trust** is the ultimate goal of any successful phishing campaign. We want our target to trust in our phish enough to entice them to follow through with what we are asking them to do. This requires we make a good impression. Put simply, our pretext must align with the target's expectations and avoid raising suspicion.

By extension, our pretext must align with our payload. For example, if our pretext suggests we are from a particular company, the landing page behind our malicious link must mirror that company's web page. The domain of the sending address and URL link must also pass at least a cursory inspection, which is why skilled phishers often purchase lookalike domain names. Minute details are also important, such as a TLS-enabled website since an insecure HTTP connection could raise suspicion. Carelessness can erode trust, so details matter.

But technical elements aren't the only factors in creating trust. We also need to use softer skills. For example, if we are impersonating a particular person (or even using their compromised email account) attempt to approximate that person's writing tone. We also want it to feel familiar and not raise suspicion. A more sophisticated tactic involves establishing rapport with the target before persuading them to open a malicious file or link.

Recognizing how to build trust (or how to exploit an existing trust relationship) is probably the most fundamental skill in successful phishing. However, there are other strategies we should consider in a phishing campaign.

_Urgency_ is a common social engineering technique used by phishers, manipulating targets into acting quickly without questioning the safety of the requested action or critically reflecting on what they're doing. Introducing a sense of urgency works best in organizations which have unhealthy work cultures. If a target often receives urgent requests and is expected to deliver on them without any critical thought, they are much more likely to fall for these kinds of manipulations.

Another strategy, _fear_, can cause a target to momentarily suspend their judgment, increasing the likelihood of compliance. _Authority_, a similar strategy to fear, can amplify the urgency of our request. This often involves taking on the role of a superior, or even the company's CEO. These strategies must be balanced as we consider elements of trust and the benefits of creating a good rapport.

Finally, we'll often leverage a positive incentive like a _reward_, in a process known as _baiting_ in which we offer something tangible to lure a target into performing an action. The promise might include a gift card, cash, or another incentive or intangible benefits like gaining favor with a superior. Offering something tangible in exchange for participation in something like a survey is not an uncommon approach for companies in general. This kind of approach might blend into the background noise for some targets.

The social elements of a phish directly correlate to the success rate of the campaign. Exploiting a trust relationship, and possibly adding other kinds of manipulations along the way, can help a target suspend their judgment, which can improve the effectiveness of a phishing campaign.

## 13.1.5. LLMs, Generative AI and Deepfakes

The introduction of [_Large Language Models_](https://www.ibm.com/topics/large-language-models) (LLMs) and [_Generative AI_](https://www.ibm.com/topics/generative-ai) (Gen AI) technologies present new opportunities for phishing and social engineering. Gen AI technologies are also particularly useful in research and LLMs in particular can advance the development of a pretext.

Some threat intelligence groups have noted the use of Gen AI in real-world phishing campaigns. For example, in 2023, [Microsoft warned of an uptick in the use of LLMs in crafting phishing emails](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365-life-hacks/privacy-and-safety/how-ai-changing-phishing-scams). Mandiant's [2024 M-Trends report](https://cloud.google.com/security/resources/m-trends) noted the rising use of [Gen AI in social engineering and information operations](https://cloud.google.com/blog/topics/threat-intelligence/threat-actors-generative-ai-limited).

However, these groups can only report on observable activity. For example, they cannot determine how end users leverage Gen AI in the planning and research stages of a phishing attack. LLMs in particular can collect relevant information about a target, as well as generate text for use in emails and websites. For example, an LLM could assist with [_Retrieval Augmented Generation_](https://cloud.google.com/use-cases/retrieval-augmented-generation) (RAG) to process a large amount of publicly-available information about a target, and distill this into material we can turn into a solid pretext. RAG may not even be necessary against high-profile targets, as the model may already have useful information. By creatively leveraging Gen AI, attackers can craft more personalized and convincing attacks.

In addition, technologies such as [_voice cloning_](https://elevenlabs.io/voice-cloning) have become much more available to the general public in recent years. These technologies allow attackers to create a voice model for an individual, based on a relatively small amount of recorded audio. They can then make this model say whatever they want. As Gen AI has become more available, the capabilities of voice cloning have become more advanced, and much harder to detect.

Deepfake videos are also being used in phishing attacks. In 2024, Architecture firm Arup fell prey [to a deepfake video scam](https://edition.cnn.com/2024/05/16/tech/arup-deepfake-scam-loss-hong-kong-intl-hnk/index.html). During a video call, deepfake clones of the CFO and other staff appeared and acted as actual employees. The deepfaked CFO signed off on a transfer of $25 million, which was then transferred to the attackers.

As Gen AI technologies become more advanced, we can leverage them as penetration testers to complement traditional phishing techniques.

A typical [_phishing campaign_](https://www.barracuda.com/support/glossary/phishing-campaign#:~:text=A%20phishing%20campaign%20is%20an,person%20in%20an%20email%20communication.) targets many people at once with generic messages designed for broad appeal.

In contrast, [_spear phishing_](https://www.ibm.com/topics/spear-phishing) targets specific individuals with personalized attacks, requiring detailed research. A spear phishing attack requires research into targets’ behaviors, preferences, and vulnerabilities to create convincing messages. This information is crucial for creating a convincing campaign and _pretext_ that the targets are likely to fall for.

Attackers now leverage [_Generative AI_](https://www.ibm.com/topics/generative-ai) (Gen AI) to improve social engineering tactics. By using AI-augmented technologies such as [_Large Language Models_](https://www.ibm.com/topics/large-language-models) (LLMs), process large amounts of public data to identify potential phishing targets. This approach helps attackers streamline the research process and personalize their attacks.

Attackers have also begun leveraging [Generative AI audio models](https://elevenlabs.io/blog/what-is-generative-ai-audio) to clone voices and generative video models to create [_deepfake_](https://www.techtarget.com/whatis/definition/deepfake) videos that convincingly replicate an individual’s facial expressions, movements, and voice patterns.

Cybercriminals use AI to make phishing harder to detect. This module teaches you how to spot and stop these threats.

In this Learning Module, we'll discuss the fundamental concepts behind a successful phishing campaign. We'll then construct and conduct our own phishing campaign in which we'll attempt to gain access to sensitive user credentials.

## 13.1. Phishing 101

This Learning Unit covers the following Learning Objectives:

-   Understanding Email Phishing
-   Exploring Smishing, Vishing, and Chatting
-   Enhancing Phishing through Social Engineering
-   Leveraging LLMs, Generative AI, and Deepfakes

Phishers have different goals: running malicious code or stealing login credentials. This objective determines the attack’s execution strategy.

Once attackers decide on an objective, they generally identify a communication method.

Email remains the most traditional and commonly used phishing medium. However, [_smishing_](https://www.ibm.com/think/topics/smishing) (SMS phishing), [_vishing_](https://www.cisco.com/site/us/en/learn/topics/security/what-is-vishing.html#:~:text=Vishing%2C%20short%20for%20voice%20phishing%2C%20refers%20to%20fraudulent%20phone%20calls,card%20numbers%2C%20or%20bank%20details.) (voice phishing), and deepfake-enhanced phishing attempts are becoming increasingly common. These methods can sometimes be combined for greater effectiveness.

This Learning Unit explains phishing approaches and how Generative AI enhances them.

## 13.1.1. Email Phishing

To better understand the social and technical mechanisms behind phishing campaigns, let's put together our own demonstration email phishing campaign.

The email text is often crafted with a particular goal, such as convincing the target to perform an action that will execute code. In this case, the attacker will likely include a malicious attachment in the email and persuade the target to open it, which triggers the execution of a specific payload. Malicious attachments can take different forms, including Office documents, PDFs, 7zip/zip archives, shortcut files, and calendar invites.

Attackers may embed a link that leads to an exploit-laden website. Clicking on these links can lead to the exploitation of vulnerabilities in specific browsers, enabling the attacker to run code on the target’s machine.

Alternatively, the email text might attempt to persuade the user to click a link which connects them to a malicious website which closely resembles a site the user often logs into. If the user logs in, the attacker gains possession of those credentials.

In phishing, a pretext is a fake story designed to convince someone to open a link or attachment. A successful attack relies on a believable [_pretext_](https://www.ibm.com/think/topics/pretexting). Small details matter—typos, bad grammar, and formatting mistakes can expose the scam. The pretext should be as believable and as seamless as possible to avoid raising suspicion.

This requires solid social engineering skills, a strong command of the target’s primary language, and details collected through research to add realism to the attack and convince the target to take the desired action.

Despite this information, crafting a convincing pretext remains complex. For example, our email must come from a familiar, or at least a seemingly benign source and we should align other email-based metadata with something the target might expect. For example, if we send an email from an unfamiliar domain, the recipient is less likely to open it and engage with it. To address this, attackers often purchase look-alike domains resembling the target’s organization, its vendors, or other familiar companies.

Along these lines, if an attacker gains access to a legitimate email account from the target's organization or one of the target's clients (perhaps by way of a public data breach or leaked credentials), they will use that account as it significantly improves their chances of success.

As for the pretext, it must align with the expectations of a target. If, for example, we're attempting to run a phishing campaign against the HR department of an organization, we should align our pretext with the kinds of emails an HR department is used to receiving. Getting this right takes some research, and often some working knowledge of the target's department and job roles.

It's also worth mentioning [_whaling_](https://www.ibm.com/topics/whale-phishing), a form of spear phishing that focuses on high-profile individuals. These targeted attacks require more care and attention than a typical phishing campaign. These pretexts are often highly customized and require significant research or inside knowledge of the target.

Info

When performing a phishing engagement for an organization, we will often receive a list of email addresses that we're not allowed to target. This list often includes high-profile individuals from the organization.

There are also very generic approaches we might take in phishing. One generic approach involves mimicking an email from a commonly used service like [_Slack_](https://slack.com/), [_Zoom_](https://zoom.us/), Google's [_Gmail_](https://mail.google.com/), or [_Microsoft Teams_](https://teams.microsoft.com/), which links to a cloned website which resembles that particular service. This is sometimes known as [_clone phishing_](https://www.proofpoint.com/uk/threat-reference/clone-phishing). This approach can be useful for large-scale phishing campaigns.

In summary, email-based phishing begins with extensive research into our target, and a solid objective. With our research and objective set, we can develop and furnish a pretext which will help achieve this objective. We then execute the phishing campaign, which synthesizes all the research and pretext work into a direct, technical campaign.

In the next section, we'll discuss other technologies we might want to consider when conducting a phishing campaign.

## 13.1.3. Smishing, Vishing, and Chatting

In addition to more-traditional email-based phishing campaigns, attackers can also leverage [_smishing_](https://www.ibm.com/topics/smishing) (a portmanteau of "SMS" and "phishing") to phish a target through SMS or other mobile messaging platforms.

SMS is a more personal and direct than email communication. The effectiveness of a smishing attack depends on the target. For example, a phishing message sent to a work phone should have a work-related context, while one sent to a personal phone would seem more authentic if it includes references to specific friends or family. In addition, since the target will not have the source phone number in their contact list, an attacker must add pretext to address this. These are crucial considerations when attempting to smish a target.

For example, in a popular ["CEO gift card scam"](https://2technical.co.uk/is-that-really-a-text-from-your-ceo-or-is-it-a-scam/), the attacker poses as a senior executive trying to send an employee a gift card. This could sway a target, especially if they believe the message came from a company executive.

Another category of phishing is voice phishing, sometimes called [_vishing_](https://www.fortinet.com/resources/cyberglossary/vishing-attack) This is a combination of ‘voice’ and ‘phishing, in which an attacker calls a target on the phone, and speaks to them directly. Traditional vishing relies more on social engineering skill rather than technical skill.

We can also use [caller ID spoofing techniques](https://usa.kaspersky.com/resource-center/preemptive-safety/phone-number-spoofing) in smishing and vishing campaigns to alter the sender or caller's source number. This has become more common because of the prevalence of Voice over Internet Protocol (VoIP) technologies.

In an adjacent style of social engineering attack known as [_SIM swapping_](https://www.natwest.com/fraud-and-security/fraud-guide/sim-swapping-scams.html), attackers call a mobile network provider and claim to be the owner of a specific mobile phone account. They then convince the network provider to transfer the phone number from the target's SIM card to a SIM card they control. This gives them control over the target's phone number, until the target is able to recover their access. This can of course be used for spoofing, but more critically, it is often used to bypass phone-based Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) protections.

As we wrap up this section, we should also highlight that chat and messaging applications are frequent phishing targets. This includes the popular [_Discord_](https://discord.com/), [_Slack_](https://slack.com/) and [Microsoft Teams](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-teams/group-chat-software) applications.

Regardless of the communication medium, attackers could adopt a broad, generic phishing approach against a broad range of targets or opt for a more precise attack against a smaller target base, depending on the overall objective.

## 13.1.4. Enhancing Phishing through Social Engineering

Now that we've briefly discussed a variety of social engineering techniques, let's discuss a few important foundational social engineering concepts and techniques that attackers typically wield in an attack.

Social engineering relies on psychological manipulation rather than technical expertise. This means attackers use more "human" judgment when deploying them, which is refined over time through some trial and error. Borrowing from this, as penetration testers, we want our phishing campaign to be as believable as possible, and adding some social engineering "spice" can introduce a little pressure which may encourage our targets to ignore their more sensible rational judgments.

Gaining the target's **trust** is the ultimate goal of any successful phishing campaign. We want our target to trust in our phish enough to entice them to follow through with what we are asking them to do. This requires we make a good impression. Put simply, our pretext must align with the target's expectations and avoid raising suspicion.

By extension, our pretext must align with our payload. For example, if our pretext suggests we are from a particular company, the landing page behind our malicious link must mirror that company's web page. The domain of the sending address and URL link must also pass at least a cursory inspection, which is why skilled phishers often purchase lookalike domain names. Minute details are also important, such as a TLS-enabled website since an insecure HTTP connection could raise suspicion. Carelessness can erode trust, so details matter.

But technical elements aren't the only factors in creating trust. We also need to use softer skills. For example, if we are impersonating a particular person (or even using their compromised email account) attempt to approximate that person's writing tone. We also want it to feel familiar and not raise suspicion. A more sophisticated tactic involves establishing rapport with the target before persuading them to open a malicious file or link.

Recognizing how to build trust (or how to exploit an existing trust relationship) is probably the most fundamental skill in successful phishing. However, there are other strategies we should consider in a phishing campaign.

_Urgency_ is a common social engineering technique used by phishers, manipulating targets into acting quickly without questioning the safety of the requested action or critically reflecting on what they're doing. Introducing a sense of urgency works best in organizations which have unhealthy work cultures. If a target often receives urgent requests and is expected to deliver on them without any critical thought, they are much more likely to fall for these kinds of manipulations.

Another strategy, _fear_, can cause a target to momentarily suspend their judgment, increasing the likelihood of compliance. _Authority_, a similar strategy to fear, can amplify the urgency of our request. This often involves taking on the role of a superior, or even the company's CEO. These strategies must be balanced as we consider elements of trust and the benefits of creating a good rapport.

Finally, we'll often leverage a positive incentive like a _reward_, in a process known as _baiting_ in which we offer something tangible to lure a target into performing an action. The promise might include a gift card, cash, or another incentive or intangible benefits like gaining favor with a superior. Offering something tangible in exchange for participation in something like a survey is not an uncommon approach for companies in general. This kind of approach might blend into the background noise for some targets.

The social elements of a phish directly correlate to the success rate of the campaign. Exploiting a trust relationship, and possibly adding other kinds of manipulations along the way, can help a target suspend their judgment, which can improve the effectiveness of a phishing campaign.

## 13.1.5. LLMs, Generative AI and Deepfakes

The introduction of [_Large Language Models_](https://www.ibm.com/topics/large-language-models) (LLMs) and [_Generative AI_](https://www.ibm.com/topics/generative-ai) (Gen AI) technologies present new opportunities for phishing and social engineering. Gen AI technologies are also particularly useful in research and LLMs in particular can advance the development of a pretext.

Some threat intelligence groups have noted the use of Gen AI in real-world phishing campaigns. For example, in 2023, [Microsoft warned of an uptick in the use of LLMs in crafting phishing emails](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365-life-hacks/privacy-and-safety/how-ai-changing-phishing-scams). Mandiant's [2024 M-Trends report](https://cloud.google.com/security/resources/m-trends) noted the rising use of [Gen AI in social engineering and information operations](https://cloud.google.com/blog/topics/threat-intelligence/threat-actors-generative-ai-limited).

However, these groups can only report on observable activity. For example, they cannot determine how end users leverage Gen AI in the planning and research stages of a phishing attack. LLMs in particular can collect relevant information about a target, as well as generate text for use in emails and websites. For example, an LLM could assist with [_Retrieval Augmented Generation_](https://cloud.google.com/use-cases/retrieval-augmented-generation) (RAG) to process a large amount of publicly-available information about a target, and distill this into material we can turn into a solid pretext. RAG may not even be necessary against high-profile targets, as the model may already have useful information. By creatively leveraging Gen AI, attackers can craft more personalized and convincing attacks.

In addition, technologies such as [_voice cloning_](https://elevenlabs.io/voice-cloning) have become much more available to the general public in recent years. These technologies allow attackers to create a voice model for an individual, based on a relatively small amount of recorded audio. They can then make this model say whatever they want. As Gen AI has become more available, the capabilities of voice cloning have become more advanced, and much harder to detect.

Deepfake videos are also being used in phishing attacks. In 2024, Architecture firm Arup fell prey [to a deepfake video scam](https://edition.cnn.com/2024/05/16/tech/arup-deepfake-scam-loss-hong-kong-intl-hnk/index.html). During a video call, deepfake clones of the CFO and other staff appeared and acted as actual employees. The deepfaked CFO signed off on a transfer of $25 million, which was then transferred to the attackers.

As Gen AI technologies become more advanced, we can leverage them as penetration testers to complement traditional phishing techniques.

A typical [_phishing campaign_](https://www.barracuda.com/support/glossary/phishing-campaign#:~:text=A%20phishing%20campaign%20is%20an,person%20in%20an%20email%20communication.) targets many people at once with generic messages designed for broad appeal.

In contrast, [_spear phishing_](https://www.ibm.com/topics/spear-phishing) targets specific individuals with personalized attacks, requiring detailed research. A spear phishing attack requires research into targets’ behaviors, preferences, and vulnerabilities to create convincing messages. This information is crucial for creating a convincing campaign and _pretext_ that the targets are likely to fall for.

Attackers now leverage [_Generative AI_](https://www.ibm.com/topics/generative-ai) (Gen AI) to improve social engineering tactics. By using AI-augmented technologies such as [_Large Language Models_](https://www.ibm.com/topics/large-language-models) (LLMs), process large amounts of public data to identify potential phishing targets. This approach helps attackers streamline the research process and personalize their attacks.

Attackers have also begun leveraging [Generative AI audio models](https://elevenlabs.io/blog/what-is-generative-ai-audio) to clone voices and generative video models to create [_deepfake_](https://www.techtarget.com/whatis/definition/deepfake) videos that convincingly replicate an individual’s facial expressions, movements, and voice patterns.

Cybercriminals use AI to make phishing harder to detect. This module teaches you how to spot and stop these threats.

In this Learning Module, we'll discuss the fundamental concepts behind a successful phishing campaign. We'll then construct and conduct our own phishing campaign in which we'll attempt to gain access to sensitive user credentials.

## 13.1. Phishing 101

This Learning Unit covers the following Learning Objectives:

-   Understanding Email Phishing
-   Exploring Smishing, Vishing, and Chatting
-   Enhancing Phishing through Social Engineering
-   Leveraging LLMs, Generative AI, and Deepfakes

Phishers have different goals: running malicious code or stealing login credentials. This objective determines the attack’s execution strategy.

Once attackers decide on an objective, they generally identify a communication method.

Email remains the most traditional and commonly used phishing medium. However, [_smishing_](https://www.ibm.com/think/topics/smishing) (SMS phishing), [_vishing_](https://www.cisco.com/site/us/en/learn/topics/security/what-is-vishing.html#:~:text=Vishing%2C%20short%20for%20voice%20phishing%2C%20refers%20to%20fraudulent%20phone%20calls,card%20numbers%2C%20or%20bank%20details.) (voice phishing), and deepfake-enhanced phishing attempts are becoming increasingly common. These methods can sometimes be combined for greater effectiveness.

This Learning Unit explains phishing approaches and how Generative AI enhances them.

## 13.1.1. Email Phishing

To better understand the social and technical mechanisms behind phishing campaigns, let's put together our own demonstration email phishing campaign.

The email text is often crafted with a particular goal, such as convincing the target to perform an action that will execute code. In this case, the attacker will likely include a malicious attachment in the email and persuade the target to open it, which triggers the execution of a specific payload. Malicious attachments can take different forms, including Office documents, PDFs, 7zip/zip archives, shortcut files, and calendar invites.

Attackers may embed a link that leads to an exploit-laden website. Clicking on these links can lead to the exploitation of vulnerabilities in specific browsers, enabling the attacker to run code on the target’s machine.

Alternatively, the email text might attempt to persuade the user to click a link which connects them to a malicious website which closely resembles a site the user often logs into. If the user logs in, the attacker gains possession of those credentials.

In phishing, a pretext is a fake story designed to convince someone to open a link or attachment. A successful attack relies on a believable [_pretext_](https://www.ibm.com/think/topics/pretexting). Small details matter—typos, bad grammar, and formatting mistakes can expose the scam. The pretext should be as believable and as seamless as possible to avoid raising suspicion.

This requires solid social engineering skills, a strong command of the target’s primary language, and details collected through research to add realism to the attack and convince the target to take the desired action.

Despite this information, crafting a convincing pretext remains complex. For example, our email must come from a familiar, or at least a seemingly benign source and we should align other email-based metadata with something the target might expect. For example, if we send an email from an unfamiliar domain, the recipient is less likely to open it and engage with it. To address this, attackers often purchase look-alike domains resembling the target’s organization, its vendors, or other familiar companies.

Along these lines, if an attacker gains access to a legitimate email account from the target's organization or one of the target's clients (perhaps by way of a public data breach or leaked credentials), they will use that account as it significantly improves their chances of success.

As for the pretext, it must align with the expectations of a target. If, for example, we're attempting to run a phishing campaign against the HR department of an organization, we should align our pretext with the kinds of emails an HR department is used to receiving. Getting this right takes some research, and often some working knowledge of the target's department and job roles.

It's also worth mentioning [_whaling_](https://www.ibm.com/topics/whale-phishing), a form of spear phishing that focuses on high-profile individuals. These targeted attacks require more care and attention than a typical phishing campaign. These pretexts are often highly customized and require significant research or inside knowledge of the target.

Info

When performing a phishing engagement for an organization, we will often receive a list of email addresses that we're not allowed to target. This list often includes high-profile individuals from the organization.

There are also very generic approaches we might take in phishing. One generic approach involves mimicking an email from a commonly used service like [_Slack_](https://slack.com/), [_Zoom_](https://zoom.us/), Google's [_Gmail_](https://mail.google.com/), or [_Microsoft Teams_](https://teams.microsoft.com/), which links to a cloned website which resembles that particular service. This is sometimes known as [_clone phishing_](https://www.proofpoint.com/uk/threat-reference/clone-phishing). This approach can be useful for large-scale phishing campaigns.

In summary, email-based phishing begins with extensive research into our target, and a solid objective. With our research and objective set, we can develop and furnish a pretext which will help achieve this objective. We then execute the phishing campaign, which synthesizes all the research and pretext work into a direct, technical campaign.

In the next section, we'll discuss other technologies we might want to consider when conducting a phishing campaign.

## 13.1.3. Smishing, Vishing, and Chatting

In addition to more-traditional email-based phishing campaigns, attackers can also leverage [_smishing_](https://www.ibm.com/topics/smishing) (a portmanteau of "SMS" and "phishing") to phish a target through SMS or other mobile messaging platforms.

SMS is a more personal and direct than email communication. The effectiveness of a smishing attack depends on the target. For example, a phishing message sent to a work phone should have a work-related context, while one sent to a personal phone would seem more authentic if it includes references to specific friends or family. In addition, since the target will not have the source phone number in their contact list, an attacker must add pretext to address this. These are crucial considerations when attempting to smish a target.

For example, in a popular ["CEO gift card scam"](https://2technical.co.uk/is-that-really-a-text-from-your-ceo-or-is-it-a-scam/), the attacker poses as a senior executive trying to send an employee a gift card. This could sway a target, especially if they believe the message came from a company executive.

Another category of phishing is voice phishing, sometimes called [_vishing_](https://www.fortinet.com/resources/cyberglossary/vishing-attack) This is a combination of ‘voice’ and ‘phishing, in which an attacker calls a target on the phone, and speaks to them directly. Traditional vishing relies more on social engineering skill rather than technical skill.

We can also use [caller ID spoofing techniques](https://usa.kaspersky.com/resource-center/preemptive-safety/phone-number-spoofing) in smishing and vishing campaigns to alter the sender or caller's source number. This has become more common because of the prevalence of Voice over Internet Protocol (VoIP) technologies.

In an adjacent style of social engineering attack known as [_SIM swapping_](https://www.natwest.com/fraud-and-security/fraud-guide/sim-swapping-scams.html), attackers call a mobile network provider and claim to be the owner of a specific mobile phone account. They then convince the network provider to transfer the phone number from the target's SIM card to a SIM card they control. This gives them control over the target's phone number, until the target is able to recover their access. This can of course be used for spoofing, but more critically, it is often used to bypass phone-based Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) protections.

As we wrap up this section, we should also highlight that chat and messaging applications are frequent phishing targets. This includes the popular [_Discord_](https://discord.com/), [_Slack_](https://slack.com/) and [Microsoft Teams](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-teams/group-chat-software) applications.

Regardless of the communication medium, attackers could adopt a broad, generic phishing approach against a broad range of targets or opt for a more precise attack against a smaller target base, depending on the overall objective.

## 13.1.4. Enhancing Phishing through Social Engineering

Now that we've briefly discussed a variety of social engineering techniques, let's discuss a few important foundational social engineering concepts and techniques that attackers typically wield in an attack.

Social engineering relies on psychological manipulation rather than technical expertise. This means attackers use more "human" judgment when deploying them, which is refined over time through some trial and error. Borrowing from this, as penetration testers, we want our phishing campaign to be as believable as possible, and adding some social engineering "spice" can introduce a little pressure which may encourage our targets to ignore their more sensible rational judgments.

Gaining the target's **trust** is the ultimate goal of any successful phishing campaign. We want our target to trust in our phish enough to entice them to follow through with what we are asking them to do. This requires we make a good impression. Put simply, our pretext must align with the target's expectations and avoid raising suspicion.

By extension, our pretext must align with our payload. For example, if our pretext suggests we are from a particular company, the landing page behind our malicious link must mirror that company's web page. The domain of the sending address and URL link must also pass at least a cursory inspection, which is why skilled phishers often purchase lookalike domain names. Minute details are also important, such as a TLS-enabled website since an insecure HTTP connection could raise suspicion. Carelessness can erode trust, so details matter.

But technical elements aren't the only factors in creating trust. We also need to use softer skills. For example, if we are impersonating a particular person (or even using their compromised email account) attempt to approximate that person's writing tone. We also want it to feel familiar and not raise suspicion. A more sophisticated tactic involves establishing rapport with the target before persuading them to open a malicious file or link.

Recognizing how to build trust (or how to exploit an existing trust relationship) is probably the most fundamental skill in successful phishing. However, there are other strategies we should consider in a phishing campaign.

_Urgency_ is a common social engineering technique used by phishers, manipulating targets into acting quickly without questioning the safety of the requested action or critically reflecting on what they're doing. Introducing a sense of urgency works best in organizations which have unhealthy work cultures. If a target often receives urgent requests and is expected to deliver on them without any critical thought, they are much more likely to fall for these kinds of manipulations.

Another strategy, _fear_, can cause a target to momentarily suspend their judgment, increasing the likelihood of compliance. _Authority_, a similar strategy to fear, can amplify the urgency of our request. This often involves taking on the role of a superior, or even the company's CEO. These strategies must be balanced as we consider elements of trust and the benefits of creating a good rapport.

Finally, we'll often leverage a positive incentive like a _reward_, in a process known as _baiting_ in which we offer something tangible to lure a target into performing an action. The promise might include a gift card, cash, or another incentive or intangible benefits like gaining favor with a superior. Offering something tangible in exchange for participation in something like a survey is not an uncommon approach for companies in general. This kind of approach might blend into the background noise for some targets.

The social elements of a phish directly correlate to the success rate of the campaign. Exploiting a trust relationship, and possibly adding other kinds of manipulations along the way, can help a target suspend their judgment, which can improve the effectiveness of a phishing campaign.

## 13.1.5. LLMs, Generative AI and Deepfakes

The introduction of [_Large Language Models_](https://www.ibm.com/topics/large-language-models) (LLMs) and [_Generative AI_](https://www.ibm.com/topics/generative-ai) (Gen AI) technologies present new opportunities for phishing and social engineering. Gen AI technologies are also particularly useful in research and LLMs in particular can advance the development of a pretext.

Some threat intelligence groups have noted the use of Gen AI in real-world phishing campaigns. For example, in 2023, [Microsoft warned of an uptick in the use of LLMs in crafting phishing emails](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365-life-hacks/privacy-and-safety/how-ai-changing-phishing-scams). Mandiant's [2024 M-Trends report](https://cloud.google.com/security/resources/m-trends) noted the rising use of [Gen AI in social engineering and information operations](https://cloud.google.com/blog/topics/threat-intelligence/threat-actors-generative-ai-limited).

However, these groups can only report on observable activity. For example, they cannot determine how end users leverage Gen AI in the planning and research stages of a phishing attack. LLMs in particular can collect relevant information about a target, as well as generate text for use in emails and websites. For example, an LLM could assist with [_Retrieval Augmented Generation_](https://cloud.google.com/use-cases/retrieval-augmented-generation) (RAG) to process a large amount of publicly-available information about a target, and distill this into material we can turn into a solid pretext. RAG may not even be necessary against high-profile targets, as the model may already have useful information. By creatively leveraging Gen AI, attackers can craft more personalized and convincing attacks.

In addition, technologies such as [_voice cloning_](https://elevenlabs.io/voice-cloning) have become much more available to the general public in recent years. These technologies allow attackers to create a voice model for an individual, based on a relatively small amount of recorded audio. They can then make this model say whatever they want. As Gen AI has become more available, the capabilities of voice cloning have become more advanced, and much harder to detect.

Deepfake videos are also being used in phishing attacks. In 2024, Architecture firm Arup fell prey [to a deepfake video scam](https://edition.cnn.com/2024/05/16/tech/arup-deepfake-scam-loss-hong-kong-intl-hnk/index.html). During a video call, deepfake clones of the CFO and other staff appeared and acted as actual employees. The deepfaked CFO signed off on a transfer of $25 million, which was then transferred to the attackers.

As Gen AI technologies become more advanced, we can leverage them as penetration testers to complement traditional phishing techniques.

A typical [_phishing campaign_](https://www.barracuda.com/support/glossary/phishing-campaign#:~:text=A%20phishing%20campaign%20is%20an,person%20in%20an%20email%20communication.) targets many people at once with generic messages designed for broad appeal.

In contrast, [_spear phishing_](https://www.ibm.com/topics/spear-phishing) targets specific individuals with personalized attacks, requiring detailed research. A spear phishing attack requires research into targets’ behaviors, preferences, and vulnerabilities to create convincing messages. This information is crucial for creating a convincing campaign and _pretext_ that the targets are likely to fall for.

Attackers now leverage [_Generative AI_](https://www.ibm.com/topics/generative-ai) (Gen AI) to improve social engineering tactics. By using AI-augmented technologies such as [_Large Language Models_](https://www.ibm.com/topics/large-language-models) (LLMs), process large amounts of public data to identify potential phishing targets. This approach helps attackers streamline the research process and personalize their attacks.

Attackers have also begun leveraging [Generative AI audio models](https://elevenlabs.io/blog/what-is-generative-ai-audio) to clone voices and generative video models to create [_deepfake_](https://www.techtarget.com/whatis/definition/deepfake) videos that convincingly replicate an individual’s facial expressions, movements, and voice patterns.

Cybercriminals use AI to make phishing harder to detect. This module teaches you how to spot and stop these threats.

In this Learning Module, we'll discuss the fundamental concepts behind a successful phishing campaign. We'll then construct and conduct our own phishing campaign in which we'll attempt to gain access to sensitive user credentials.

## 13.1. Phishing 101

This Learning Unit covers the following Learning Objectives:

-   Understanding Email Phishing
-   Exploring Smishing, Vishing, and Chatting
-   Enhancing Phishing through Social Engineering
-   Leveraging LLMs, Generative AI, and Deepfakes

Phishers have different goals: running malicious code or stealing login credentials. This objective determines the attack’s execution strategy.

Once attackers decide on an objective, they generally identify a communication method.

Email remains the most traditional and commonly used phishing medium. However, [_smishing_](https://www.ibm.com/think/topics/smishing) (SMS phishing), [_vishing_](https://www.cisco.com/site/us/en/learn/topics/security/what-is-vishing.html#:~:text=Vishing%2C%20short%20for%20voice%20phishing%2C%20refers%20to%20fraudulent%20phone%20calls,card%20numbers%2C%20or%20bank%20details.) (voice phishing), and deepfake-enhanced phishing attempts are becoming increasingly common. These methods can sometimes be combined for greater effectiveness.

This Learning Unit explains phishing approaches and how Generative AI enhances them.

## 13.1.1. Email Phishing

To better understand the social and technical mechanisms behind phishing campaigns, let's put together our own demonstration email phishing campaign.

The email text is often crafted with a particular goal, such as convincing the target to perform an action that will execute code. In this case, the attacker will likely include a malicious attachment in the email and persuade the target to open it, which triggers the execution of a specific payload. Malicious attachments can take different forms, including Office documents, PDFs, 7zip/zip archives, shortcut files, and calendar invites.

Attackers may embed a link that leads to an exploit-laden website. Clicking on these links can lead to the exploitation of vulnerabilities in specific browsers, enabling the attacker to run code on the target’s machine.

Alternatively, the email text might attempt to persuade the user to click a link which connects them to a malicious website which closely resembles a site the user often logs into. If the user logs in, the attacker gains possession of those credentials.

In phishing, a pretext is a fake story designed to convince someone to open a link or attachment. A successful attack relies on a believable [_pretext_](https://www.ibm.com/think/topics/pretexting). Small details matter—typos, bad grammar, and formatting mistakes can expose the scam. The pretext should be as believable and as seamless as possible to avoid raising suspicion.

This requires solid social engineering skills, a strong command of the target’s primary language, and details collected through research to add realism to the attack and convince the target to take the desired action.

Despite this information, crafting a convincing pretext remains complex. For example, our email must come from a familiar, or at least a seemingly benign source and we should align other email-based metadata with something the target might expect. For example, if we send an email from an unfamiliar domain, the recipient is less likely to open it and engage with it. To address this, attackers often purchase look-alike domains resembling the target’s organization, its vendors, or other familiar companies.

Along these lines, if an attacker gains access to a legitimate email account from the target's organization or one of the target's clients (perhaps by way of a public data breach or leaked credentials), they will use that account as it significantly improves their chances of success.

As for the pretext, it must align with the expectations of a target. If, for example, we're attempting to run a phishing campaign against the HR department of an organization, we should align our pretext with the kinds of emails an HR department is used to receiving. Getting this right takes some research, and often some working knowledge of the target's department and job roles.

It's also worth mentioning [_whaling_](https://www.ibm.com/topics/whale-phishing), a form of spear phishing that focuses on high-profile individuals. These targeted attacks require more care and attention than a typical phishing campaign. These pretexts are often highly customized and require significant research or inside knowledge of the target.

Info

When performing a phishing engagement for an organization, we will often receive a list of email addresses that we're not allowed to target. This list often includes high-profile individuals from the organization.

There are also very generic approaches we might take in phishing. One generic approach involves mimicking an email from a commonly used service like [_Slack_](https://slack.com/), [_Zoom_](https://zoom.us/), Google's [_Gmail_](https://mail.google.com/), or [_Microsoft Teams_](https://teams.microsoft.com/), which links to a cloned website which resembles that particular service. This is sometimes known as [_clone phishing_](https://www.proofpoint.com/uk/threat-reference/clone-phishing). This approach can be useful for large-scale phishing campaigns.

In summary, email-based phishing begins with extensive research into our target, and a solid objective. With our research and objective set, we can develop and furnish a pretext which will help achieve this objective. We then execute the phishing campaign, which synthesizes all the research and pretext work into a direct, technical campaign.

In the next section, we'll discuss other technologies we might want to consider when conducting a phishing campaign.

## 13.1.3. Smishing, Vishing, and Chatting

In addition to more-traditional email-based phishing campaigns, attackers can also leverage [_smishing_](https://www.ibm.com/topics/smishing) (a portmanteau of "SMS" and "phishing") to phish a target through SMS or other mobile messaging platforms.

SMS is a more personal and direct than email communication. The effectiveness of a smishing attack depends on the target. For example, a phishing message sent to a work phone should have a work-related context, while one sent to a personal phone would seem more authentic if it includes references to specific friends or family. In addition, since the target will not have the source phone number in their contact list, an attacker must add pretext to address this. These are crucial considerations when attempting to smish a target.

For example, in a popular ["CEO gift card scam"](https://2technical.co.uk/is-that-really-a-text-from-your-ceo-or-is-it-a-scam/), the attacker poses as a senior executive trying to send an employee a gift card. This could sway a target, especially if they believe the message came from a company executive.

Another category of phishing is voice phishing, sometimes called [_vishing_](https://www.fortinet.com/resources/cyberglossary/vishing-attack) This is a combination of ‘voice’ and ‘phishing, in which an attacker calls a target on the phone, and speaks to them directly. Traditional vishing relies more on social engineering skill rather than technical skill.

We can also use [caller ID spoofing techniques](https://usa.kaspersky.com/resource-center/preemptive-safety/phone-number-spoofing) in smishing and vishing campaigns to alter the sender or caller's source number. This has become more common because of the prevalence of Voice over Internet Protocol (VoIP) technologies.

In an adjacent style of social engineering attack known as [_SIM swapping_](https://www.natwest.com/fraud-and-security/fraud-guide/sim-swapping-scams.html), attackers call a mobile network provider and claim to be the owner of a specific mobile phone account. They then convince the network provider to transfer the phone number from the target's SIM card to a SIM card they control. This gives them control over the target's phone number, until the target is able to recover their access. This can of course be used for spoofing, but more critically, it is often used to bypass phone-based Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) protections.

As we wrap up this section, we should also highlight that chat and messaging applications are frequent phishing targets. This includes the popular [_Discord_](https://discord.com/), [_Slack_](https://slack.com/) and [Microsoft Teams](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-teams/group-chat-software) applications.

Regardless of the communication medium, attackers could adopt a broad, generic phishing approach against a broad range of targets or opt for a more precise attack against a smaller target base, depending on the overall objective.

## 13.1.4. Enhancing Phishing through Social Engineering

Now that we've briefly discussed a variety of social engineering techniques, let's discuss a few important foundational social engineering concepts and techniques that attackers typically wield in an attack.

Social engineering relies on psychological manipulation rather than technical expertise. This means attackers use more "human" judgment when deploying them, which is refined over time through some trial and error. Borrowing from this, as penetration testers, we want our phishing campaign to be as believable as possible, and adding some social engineering "spice" can introduce a little pressure which may encourage our targets to ignore their more sensible rational judgments.

Gaining the target's **trust** is the ultimate goal of any successful phishing campaign. We want our target to trust in our phish enough to entice them to follow through with what we are asking them to do. This requires we make a good impression. Put simply, our pretext must align with the target's expectations and avoid raising suspicion.

By extension, our pretext must align with our payload. For example, if our pretext suggests we are from a particular company, the landing page behind our malicious link must mirror that company's web page. The domain of the sending address and URL link must also pass at least a cursory inspection, which is why skilled phishers often purchase lookalike domain names. Minute details are also important, such as a TLS-enabled website since an insecure HTTP connection could raise suspicion. Carelessness can erode trust, so details matter.

But technical elements aren't the only factors in creating trust. We also need to use softer skills. For example, if we are impersonating a particular person (or even using their compromised email account) attempt to approximate that person's writing tone. We also want it to feel familiar and not raise suspicion. A more sophisticated tactic involves establishing rapport with the target before persuading them to open a malicious file or link.

Recognizing how to build trust (or how to exploit an existing trust relationship) is probably the most fundamental skill in successful phishing. However, there are other strategies we should consider in a phishing campaign.

_Urgency_ is a common social engineering technique used by phishers, manipulating targets into acting quickly without questioning the safety of the requested action or critically reflecting on what they're doing. Introducing a sense of urgency works best in organizations which have unhealthy work cultures. If a target often receives urgent requests and is expected to deliver on them without any critical thought, they are much more likely to fall for these kinds of manipulations.

Another strategy, _fear_, can cause a target to momentarily suspend their judgment, increasing the likelihood of compliance. _Authority_, a similar strategy to fear, can amplify the urgency of our request. This often involves taking on the role of a superior, or even the company's CEO. These strategies must be balanced as we consider elements of trust and the benefits of creating a good rapport.

Finally, we'll often leverage a positive incentive like a _reward_, in a process known as _baiting_ in which we offer something tangible to lure a target into performing an action. The promise might include a gift card, cash, or another incentive or intangible benefits like gaining favor with a superior. Offering something tangible in exchange for participation in something like a survey is not an uncommon approach for companies in general. This kind of approach might blend into the background noise for some targets.

The social elements of a phish directly correlate to the success rate of the campaign. Exploiting a trust relationship, and possibly adding other kinds of manipulations along the way, can help a target suspend their judgment, which can improve the effectiveness of a phishing campaign.

## 13.1.5. LLMs, Generative AI and Deepfakes

The introduction of [_Large Language Models_](https://www.ibm.com/topics/large-language-models) (LLMs) and [_Generative AI_](https://www.ibm.com/topics/generative-ai) (Gen AI) technologies present new opportunities for phishing and social engineering. Gen AI technologies are also particularly useful in research and LLMs in particular can advance the development of a pretext.

Some threat intelligence groups have noted the use of Gen AI in real-world phishing campaigns. For example, in 2023, [Microsoft warned of an uptick in the use of LLMs in crafting phishing emails](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365-life-hacks/privacy-and-safety/how-ai-changing-phishing-scams). Mandiant's [2024 M-Trends report](https://cloud.google.com/security/resources/m-trends) noted the rising use of [Gen AI in social engineering and information operations](https://cloud.google.com/blog/topics/threat-intelligence/threat-actors-generative-ai-limited).

However, these groups can only report on observable activity. For example, they cannot determine how end users leverage Gen AI in the planning and research stages of a phishing attack. LLMs in particular can collect relevant information about a target, as well as generate text for use in emails and websites. For example, an LLM could assist with [_Retrieval Augmented Generation_](https://cloud.google.com/use-cases/retrieval-augmented-generation) (RAG) to process a large amount of publicly-available information about a target, and distill this into material we can turn into a solid pretext. RAG may not even be necessary against high-profile targets, as the model may already have useful information. By creatively leveraging Gen AI, attackers can craft more personalized and convincing attacks.

In addition, technologies such as [_voice cloning_](https://elevenlabs.io/voice-cloning) have become much more available to the general public in recent years. These technologies allow attackers to create a voice model for an individual, based on a relatively small amount of recorded audio. They can then make this model say whatever they want. As Gen AI has become more available, the capabilities of voice cloning have become more advanced, and much harder to detect.

Deepfake videos are also being used in phishing attacks. In 2024, Architecture firm Arup fell prey [to a deepfake video scam](https://edition.cnn.com/2024/05/16/tech/arup-deepfake-scam-loss-hong-kong-intl-hnk/index.html). During a video call, deepfake clones of the CFO and other staff appeared and acted as actual employees. The deepfaked CFO signed off on a transfer of $25 million, which was then transferred to the attackers.

As Gen AI technologies become more advanced, we can leverage them as penetration testers to complement traditional phishing techniques.
