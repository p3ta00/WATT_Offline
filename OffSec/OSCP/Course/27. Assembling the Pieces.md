# 27\. Assembling the Pieces

In this Learning Module, we will cover the following Learning Units:

-   Enumerating the Public Network
-   Attacking a Public Machine
-   Gaining Access to the Internal Network
-   Enumerating the Internal Network
-   Attacking an Internal Web Application
-   Gaining Access to the Domain Controller

Now that we have introduced all the individual pieces of a penetration test, it's time to put them together in a walkthrough. In this Module, we will conduct a simulated penetration test inspired by real-world findings.

The purpose of this Module is to act as a bridge between the PEN200 Modules and the Challenge Labs. One way to think about this Module is as "Challenge Lab Zero". If you wish, you can start the machines and attempt to attack them on your own, and then come back and read the methodology and story described here. Either way, we recommend following this methodology and the mindset it produces for tackling the Challenge Labs 1-6. Note that to save time, in several cases we will skip steps that will not yield results for this simulation. However, we will call out these instances as they occur.

In this scenario, the company _BEYOND Finances_ has tasked us with conducting a penetration test of their IT infrastructure. The client wants to determine if an attacker can breach the perimeter and get domain admin privileges in the internal _Active Directory_ (AD) environment. In this assessment, the client's goals for us are to obtain domain administrator privileges and access the domain controller.

We should be aware that each client may have different end goals for a penetration test based on their threat level, data infrastructure, and business model. For example, if the client's main business is warehousing data, our goal could be to obtain that data. That is because a breach of this nature would cause the most significant business impact to the client. In most environments, domain administrator access would help us accomplish that goal, but that is not always the case.

## 27.1. Enumerating the Public Network

This Learning Unit covers the following Learning Objectives:

-   Enumerate machines on a public network
-   Obtain useful information to use for later attacks

In this Learning Unit, we'll start with the first step of our penetration test, _enumeration_. Our fictitious client has provided us with two initial targets, which we can access via the PEN200 VPN. The following figure shows a network overview based on the client's information.

![Figure 1: Network Overview of provided Targets](https://static.offsec.com/offsec-courses/PEN-200/imgs/atpr/710911bfff2996b5b273a701ae9aaf4a-atp_ext.png)

Figure 1: Network Overview of provided Targets

Figure 1 shows the two accessible machines, WEBSRV1 and MAILSRV1, as well as their corresponding IP addresses.

The third octet you observe in your own lab instance may differ when starting the VM group later.

In the first section, we'll begin by setting up a basic work environment for our penetration test and then enumerate MAILSRV1.

## 27.1.1. MAILSRV1

Before we begin to interact with our target to enumerate it, let's set up a work environment for this penetration test. This will help us to store obtained files and information in a structured way throughout the assessment. In later phases of a penetration test, this will prove especially helpful as we'll collect a huge amount of data and information.

Structuring and isolating data and settings for multiple penetration tests can be quite the challenge. By reusing a Kali VM, we could accidentally expose previous-client data to new networks. Therefore, it is recommended to use a fresh Kali image for every assessment.

For this reason, let's create a **/home/kali/beyond** directory on our Kali VM. In it, we'll create two directories named after the two target machines we have access to now. In addition, we'll create a **creds.txt** text file to keep track of identified valid credentials and users.

```
kali@kali:~$ mkdir beyond

kali@kali:~$ cd beyond

kali@kali:~/beyond$ mkdir mailsrv1

kali@kali:~/beyond$ mkdir websrv1

kali@kali:~/beyond$ touch creds.txt
```

> Listing 1 - Basic work environment for this penetration test

Now that we set up a work environment, we are ready to enumerate the first target machine, MAILSRV1.

Documenting our findings is a crucial process for every penetration test. For this Module, we'll store results in the basic work environment we just set up. However, Markdown editors, such as [_Obsidian_](https://obsidian.md/), have become [quite popular](https://www.trustedsec.com/blog/obsidian-taming-a-collective-consciousness/) for documenting findings and data in real assessments as they are application-independent and contain functions that will simplify report writing and collaboration.

Let's begin with a port scan of MAILSRV1 using _Nmap_. A port scan is often the first active information gathering method we'll perform to get an overview of open ports and accessible services.

In a real penetration test, we would also use passive information gathering techniques such as _Google Dorks_ and leaked password databases to obtain additional information. This would potentially provide us with usernames, passwords, and sensitive information.

We'll use **\-sV** to enable service and version detection as well as **\-sC** to use Nmap's default scripts. In addition, we'll enter **\-oN** to create an output file containing the scan results.

```

> Listing 2 - Nmap scan of MAILSRV1

Listing 2 shows that Nmap discovered eight open ports. Based on this information, we can establish that the target machine is a Windows system running an _IIS web server_ and a [_hMailServer_](https://www.hmailserver.com/). This is not surprising as the machine is named MAILSRV1 in the topology provided by the client.

In a real-world penetration test, the hostnames may not always be as descriptive as they are in this Module.

As we may not be familiar with [hMailServer](https://www.hmailserver.com/), we can research this application by browsing the application's web page. It states that hMailServer is a free, open-source e-mail server for Microsoft Windows.

To identify potential vulnerabilities in hMailServer, we can use a search engine to find [CVEs and public exploits](https://www.cvedetails.com/vulnerability-list/vendor_id-8442/Hmailserver.html). However, as Nmap didn't discover a version number, we have to conduct a broader search. Unfortunately, the search didn't provide any meaningful results apart from some older CVEs.

![Figure 2: Vulnerabilities of hMailServer](https://static.offsec.com/offsec-courses/PEN-200/imgs/atpr/bfa13c165151681396a05b52226a1057-atp_hmail.png)

Figure 2: Vulnerabilities of hMailServer

Even if we had found a vulnerability with a matching exploit providing the code execution, we should not skip the remaining enumeration steps. While we may get access to the target system, we could potentially miss out on vital data or information for other services and systems.

Next, let's enumerate the IIS web server. First, we'll browse the web page.

![Figure 3: IIS Welcome Page on MAILSRV1](https://static.offsec.com/offsec-courses/PEN-200/imgs/atpr/1c1253c40ee9c3f071a79372c047f08a-mailsrv_iis.png)

Figure 3: IIS Welcome Page on MAILSRV1

Figure 3 shows that IIS only displays the default welcome page. Let's try to identify directories and files by using **gobuster**. We'll enter **dir** to use directory enumeration mode, **\-u** for the URL, **\-w** for a wordlist, and **\-x** for file types we want to identify. For this example, we'll enter **txt**, **pdf**, and **config** to identify potential documents or configuration files. In addition, we'll use **\-o** to create an output file.

```

> Listing 3 - Using gobuster to identify pages and files on MAILSRV1

Listing 3 shows that gobuster did not identify any pages, files, or directories.

Not every enumeration technique needs to provide actionable results. In the initial information gathering phase, it is important to perform a variety of enumeration methods to get a complete picture of a system.

Let's summarize what information we obtained while enumerating MAILSRV1 so far. First, we launched a port scan with Nmap, which identified a running IIS web server and hMailServer. In addition, we established that the target is running Windows, then enumerated the running web server more closely. Unfortunately, this didn't provide any actionable information for us.

We cannot use the mail server at this moment. If we identify valid credentials and targets later in the penetration test, we could perhaps use the mail server to send a phishing email, for example.

This cyclical nature of a penetration test is an important concept for us to grasp because it provides a mindset of continuously reevaluating and including new information to follow previously inapproachable or newly identified attack vectors.

Please note that the IP addresses assigned to your target machines may not match those referenced in the Module text and video.

Assembling the Pieces - VM Group

#### Labs

Start the VM group to follow along the guided penetration test throughout the Module. Once you have access to the domain controller, retrieve the NTLM hash of the domain administrator account _BEYOND\\Administrator_ and enter it as answer to this exercise.

Please make sure you are dumping the NTLM hash of the domain administrator user with RID 500 by utilizing dcsync attack via mimikatz, not by extracting creds from SAM file. The hashes will be different.

Now that we set up a work environment, we are ready to enumerate the first target machine, MAILSRV1.

Documenting our findings is a crucial process for every penetration test. For this Module, we'll store results in the basic work environment we just set up. However, Markdown editors, such as [_Obsidian_](https://obsidian.md/), have become [quite popular](https://www.trustedsec.com/blog/obsidian-taming-a-collective-consciousness/) for documenting findings and data in real assessments as they are application-independent and contain functions that will simplify report writing and collaboration.

Let's begin with a port scan of MAILSRV1 using _Nmap_. A port scan is often the first active information gathering method we'll perform to get an overview of open ports and accessible services.

In a real penetration test, we would also use passive information gathering techniques such as _Google Dorks_ and leaked password databases to obtain additional information. This would potentially provide us with usernames, passwords, and sensitive information.

We'll use **\-sV** to enable service and version detection as well as **\-sC** to use Nmap's default scripts. In addition, we'll enter **\-oN** to create an output file containing the scan results.

```

> Listing 2 - Nmap scan of MAILSRV1

Listing 2 shows that Nmap discovered eight open ports. Based on this information, we can establish that the target machine is a Windows system running an _IIS web server_ and a [_hMailServer_](https://www.hmailserver.com/). This is not surprising as the machine is named MAILSRV1 in the topology provided by the client.

In a real-world penetration test, the hostnames may not always be as descriptive as they are in this Module.

As we may not be familiar with [hMailServer](https://www.hmailserver.com/), we can research this application by browsing the application's web page. It states that hMailServer is a free, open-source e-mail server for Microsoft Windows.

To identify potential vulnerabilities in hMailServer, we can use a search engine to find [CVEs and public exploits](https://www.cvedetails.com/vulnerability-list/vendor_id-8442/Hmailserver.html). However, as Nmap didn't discover a version number, we have to conduct a broader search. Unfortunately, the search didn't provide any meaningful results apart from some older CVEs.

![Figure 2: Vulnerabilities of hMailServer](https://static.offsec.com/offsec-courses/PEN-200/imgs/atpr/bfa13c165151681396a05b52226a1057-atp_hmail.png)

Figure 2: Vulnerabilities of hMailServer

Even if we had found a vulnerability with a matching exploit providing the code execution, we should not skip the remaining enumeration steps. While we may get access to the target system, we could potentially miss out on vital data or information for other services and systems.

Next, let's enumerate the IIS web server. First, we'll browse the web page.

Figure 3: IIS Welcome Page on MAILSRV1

Figure 3 shows that IIS only displays the default welcome page. Let's try to identify directories and files by using **gobuster**. We'll enter **dir** to use directory enumeration mode, **\-u** for the URL, **\-w** for a wordlist, and **\-x** for file types we want to identify. For this example, we'll enter **txt**, **pdf**, and **config** to identify potential documents or configuration files. In addition, we'll use **\-o** to create an output file.

```

> Listing 3 - Using gobuster to identify pages and files on MAILSRV1

Listing 3 shows that gobuster did not identify any pages, files, or directories.

Not every enumeration technique needs to provide actionable results. In the initial information gathering phase, it is important to perform a variety of enumeration methods to get a complete picture of a system.

Let's summarize what information we obtained while enumerating MAILSRV1 so far. First, we launched a port scan with Nmap, which identified a running IIS web server and hMailServer. In addition, we established that the target is running Windows, then enumerated the running web server more closely. Unfortunately, this didn't provide any actionable information for us.

We cannot use the mail server at this moment. If we identify valid credentials and targets later in the penetration test, we could perhaps use the mail server to send a phishing email, for example.

This cyclical nature of a penetration test is an important concept for us to grasp because it provides a mindset of continuously reevaluating and including new information to follow previously inapproachable or newly identified attack vectors.

## Resources

Some of the labs require you to start the target machine(s) below.

Please note that the IP addresses assigned to your target machines may not match those referenced in the Module text and video.

Assembling the Pieces - VM Group

#### Labs

Start the VM group to follow along the guided penetration test throughout the Module. Once you have access to the domain controller, retrieve the NTLM hash of the domain administrator account _BEYOND\\Administrator_ and enter it as answer to this exercise.

Please make sure you are dumping the NTLM hash of the domain administrator user with RID 500 by utilizing dcsync attack via mimikatz, not by extracting creds from SAM file. The hashes will be different.
