In this Learning Module, we will cover the following Learning Units:

- Introduction to Active Directory
- Active Directory enumeration using manual tools
- Enumerating Active Directory using automated tools

[_Active Directory Domain Services_](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-server/identity/ad-ds/get-started/virtual-dc/active-directory-domain-services-overview), often referred to as Active Directory (AD), is a service that allows system administrators to update and manage operating systems, applications, users, and data access on a large scale. Active Directory is installed with a standard configuration; however, system administrators often customize it to fit the needs of the organization.

From a penetration tester's perspective, Active Directory is very interesting as it typically contains a wealth of information. If we successfully compromise certain objects within the domain, we may be able to take full control over the organization's infrastructure.

In this Learning Module, we will focus on the enumeration aspect of Active Directory. The information we will gather throughout the Module will have a direct impact on the various attacks we will do in the upcoming _Attacking Active Directory Authentication_ and _Lateral Movement in Active Directory_ Modules.

## 22.1. Active Directory - Introduction

This Learning Unit will cover the following Learning Objectives:

- Introduction to Active Directory
- Define our enumeration goals

While Active Directory itself is a service, it also acts as a management layer. AD contains critical information about the environment, storing information about users, groups, and computers, each referred to as _objects_. Permissions set on each object dictate the privileges that object has within the domain

Configuring and maintaining an instance of Active Directory can be daunting for administrators, especially since the wealth of contained information often creates a large attack surface.

The first step in configuring an instance of AD is to create a domain name such as _corp.com_ in which _corp_ is often the name of the organization itself. Within this domain, administrators can add various types of objects that are associated with the organization such as computers, users, and group objects.

An AD environment has a critical dependency on the _Domain Name System_ (DNS) service. As such, a typical domain controller will also host a DNS server that is authoritative for a given domain.

To ease the management of various objects and assist with management, system administrators often organize these objects into [_Organizational Units_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Organizational_unit_\(computing\)) (OUs).

OUs are comparable to file system folders in that they are containers used to store objects within the domain. Computer objects represent actual servers and workstations that are domain-joined (part of the domain), and user objects represent accounts that can be used to log in to the domain-joined computers. In addition, all AD objects contain attributes, which will vary depending on the type of object. For example, a user object may include attributes such as first name, last name, username, phone number, etc.

AD relies on several components and communication services. For example, when a user attempts to log in to the domain, a request is sent to a [_Domain Controller_](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/openspecs/windows_protocols/ms-authsod/c4012a57-16a9-42eb-8f64-aa9e04698dca) (DC), which checks whether or not the user is allowed to log in to the domain. One or more DCs act as the hub and core of the domain, storing all OUs, objects, and their attributes. Since the DC is such a central domain component, we'll pay close attention to it as we enumerate AD.

Objects can be assigned to AD groups so that administrators can manage those objects as a single unit. For example, users in a group could be given access to a file server share or given administrative access to various clients in the domain. Attackers often target high-privileged groups.

Members of [_Domain Admins_](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-server/identity/ad-ds/manage/understand-security-groups#domain-admins) are among the most privileged objects in the domain. If an attacker compromises a member of this group (often referred to as _domain administrators_), they essentially gain complete control over the domain.

This attack vector could extend beyond a single domain since an AD instance can host more than one domain in a _domain tree_ or multiple domain trees in a _domain forest_. While there is a Domain Admins group for each domain in the forest, members of the _Enterprise Admins_ group are granted full control over all the domains in the forest and have Administrator privilege on all DCs. This is obviously a high-value target for an attacker.

We will leverage these and other concepts in this Module as we focus on the extremely important aspect of AD enumeration. This important discipline can improve our success during the attack phase. We will leverage a variety of tools to manually enumerate AD, most of which rely on the [_Lightweight Directory Access Protocol_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lightweight_Directory_Access_Protocol) (LDAP). Once we've introduced foundational techniques, we will leverage automation to perform enumeration at scale.

## 22.1.1. Enumeration - Defining our Goals

Before we begin, let's discuss the scenario and define our goals.

In this scenario, we'll enumerate the _corp.com_ domain. We've obtained user credentials to a domain user through a successful phishing attack. Alternatively, the target organization may have provided us with user credentials so that we can perform penetration testing based on an _assumed breach_. This would speed up the process for us and give the organization insight into how easily attackers can move within their environment once they have gained initial access.

The user we have access to is _stephanie_ who has remote desktop permissions on a Windows 11 machine that is a part of the domain. This user is not a local administrator on the machine, which is something we may need to take into consideration as we move along.

During a real-world assessment, the organization may also define the scope and goals of the penetration test. In our case however, we are restricted to the _corp.com_ domain with the PWK labs. Our goal will be to enumerate the full domain, including finding possible ways to achieve the highest privilege possible (domain administrator in this case).

In this Module, we will perform the enumeration from one client machine with the low privileged _stephanie_ domain user. However, once we start performing attacks and we can gain access to additional users and computers, we may have to repeat parts of the enumeration process from the new standpoint. This perspective shift (or _pivot_) is critical during the enumeration process considering the complexity of permissions across the domain. Each pivot may give us an opportunity to advance our attack.

For example, if we gain access to another low-privileged user account that seems to have the same access as _stephanie_, we shouldn't simply dismiss it. Instead, we should always repeat our enumeration with that new account since administrators often grant individual users increased permissions based on their unique role in the organization. This persistent "rinse and repeat" process is the key to successful enumeration and works extremely well, especially in large organizations.

## 22.2. Active Directory - Manual Enumeration

This Learning Unit will cover the following Learning Objectives:

- Enumerate Active Directory using legacy Windows applications
- Use PowerShell and .NET to perform additional AD enumeration

There are many ways to enumerate AD and a wide variety of tools we can use. In this Learning Unit, we will start enumerating the domain using tools that are already installed in Windows. We will start with the "low-hanging fruit", the information we can gather quickly and easily. Eventually, we will leverage more robust techniques such as invoking .NET classes using PowerShell to communicate with AD via LDAP.

## 22.2.1. Active Directory - Enumeration Using Legacy Windows Tools

Since we are starting in an _assumed breach_ scenario and we have credentials for _stephanie_, we will use those credentials to authenticate to the domain via a Windows 11 machine (CLIENT75). We'll use the _Remote Desktop Protocol_ (RDP) with _xfreerdp_ to connect to the client and log in to the domain. We'll supply the user name with **/u**, the domain name with **/d** and enter the password, which in this case is _LegmanTeamBenzoin!!_.

```
kali@kali:~$ xfreerdp /u:stephanie /d:corp.com /v:192.168.50.75
```

> Listing 1 - Connecting to the Windows 11 client using "xfreerdp"

AD contains so much information that it can be hard to determine where to start enumerating. But since every AD installation fundamentally contains users and groups, we'll start there.

Warning

When you have access to AD credentials, we suggest using RDP as much as possible. If you use PowerShell Remoting and winrm to connect to a machine, you may no longer be able to run domain enumeration tools as you will experience the [Kerberos Double Hop](https://posts.slayerlabs.com/double-hop/) issue. To avoid it, the simplest way is to use RDP. Kerberos Double-Hop is discussed in detail in the PEN-300 course material.

To start gathering user information, we will use [**net.exe**](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-US/troubleshoot/windows-server/networking/net-commands-on-operating-systems), which is installed by default on all Windows operating systems. More specifically, we will use the [**net user**](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/previous-versions/windows/it-pro/windows-server-2012-R2-and-2012/cc771865\(v=ws.11\)?redirectedfrom=MSDN) sub-command. While we can use this tool to enumerate local accounts on the machine, we'll instead use **/domain** to print out the users in the domain.

```
C:\Users\stephanie>net user /domain
The request will be processed at a domain controller for domain corp.com.

User accounts for \\DC1.corp.com

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

jen                      krbtgt                   pete
stephanie
The command completed successfully.
```

> Listing 2 - Running "net user" to display users in the domain

The output from this command will vary depending on the size of the organization. Armed with a list of users, we can now query information about individual users.

Administrators often tend to add prefixes or suffixes to usernames that identify accounts by their function. Based on the output in Listing 2, we should check out the _jeffadmin_ user because it might be an administrative account.

Let's inspect the user with **net.exe** and the **/domain** flag:

```
C:\Users\stephanie>net user jeffadmin /domain
The request will be processed at a domain controller for domain corp.com.

User name                    jeffadmin

```

> Listing 3 - Running "net user" against a specific user

According to the output, _jeffadmin_ is a part of the _Domain Admins_ group, which is something we should take note of. If we manage to compromise this account, we'll essentially elevate ourselves to domain administrator.

We can also use **net.exe** to enumerate groups in the domain with [**net group**](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/previous-versions/windows/it-pro/windows-server-2008-R2-and-2008/cc754051\(v=ws.10\)?redirectedfrom=MSDN):

```
C:\Users\stephanie>net group /domain

The command completed successfully.
```

> Listing 4 - Running "net group" to display groups in the domain

The output includes a long list of groups in the domain. Some of these are [installed by default](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-server/identity/ad-ds/manage/understand-security-groups). Others, like those highlighted above, are custom groups created by the administrator. Let's enumerate a custom group first.

We'll again use **net.exe** to enumerate the group members, this time focusing on the _Sales Department_ group.

```
PS C:\Tools> net group "Sales Department" /domain
The request will be processed at a domain controller for domain corp.com.

Group name     Sales Department
Comment

Members

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
pete                     stephanie
The command completed successfully.
```

> Listing 5 - Running "net group" to display members in specific group

This reveals that _pete_ and _stephanie_ are members of the _Sales Department_ group.

Although this doesn't seem to reveal much, each small piece of information gained through enumeration is potentially valuable. In a real-world assessment, we might enumerate each group, cataloging the results. This will require good organization, which we'll discuss later, but we'll move on for now as we have more flexible alternatives to net.exe to discuss in the next section.

## 22.2.2. Enumerating Active Directory using PowerShell and .NET Classes

There are several tools we can use to enumerate Active Directory. PowerShell cmdlets like [_Get-ADUser_](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/module/activedirectory/get-aduser?view=windowsserver2022-ps) work well but they are only installed by default on domain controllers as part of the [_Remote Server Administration Tools_](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/troubleshoot/windows-server/system-management-components/remote-server-administration-tools) (RSAT). RSAT is very rarely present on clients in a domain, and we must have administrative privileges to install them. While we can, in principle, import the DLL required for enumeration ourselves, we will investigate other options.

We'll develop a tool that requires only basic privileges and is flexible enough to use in real-world engagements. We will mimic the queries that occur as part of AD's regular operation. This will help us understand the basic concepts used in the pre-built tools we'll use later.

Specifically, we'll use PowerShell and .NET classes to create a script that enumerates the domain. Although PowerShell development can seem complex, we'll take it one step at a time.

To enumerate AD, we first need to understand how to communicate with the service. Before we start building our script, let's discuss some theory.

AD enumeration relies on LDAP. When a domain machine searches for an object, like a printer, or when we query user or group objects, LDAP is used as the communication channel for the query. In other words, LDAP is the protocol used to communicate with Active Directory.

LDAP is not exclusive to AD. Other directory services use it as well.

LDAP communication with AD is not always straight-forward, but we'll leverage an [_Active Directory Services Interface_](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/adsi/active-directory-service-interfaces-adsi) (ADSI) (a set of interfaces built on [_COM_](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/com/com-objects-and-interfaces)) as an LDAP provider.

According to [Microsoft's documentation](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/adsi/ldap-adspath?redirectedfrom=MSDN), we need a specific LDAP _ADsPath_ in order to communicate with the AD service. The LDAP path's prototype looks like this:

```
LDAP://HostName[:PortNumber][/DistinguishedName]
```

> Listing 6 - LDAP path format

We need three parameters for a full LDAP path: _HostName_, _PortNumber_, and a _DistinguishedName_. Let's take a moment to break this down.

The _Hostname_ can be a computer name, IP address or a domain name. In our case, we are working with the _corp.com_ domain, so we could simply add that to our LDAP path and likely obtain information. Note that a domain may have multiple DCs, so setting the domain name could potentially resolve to the IP address of any DC in the domain.

While this would likely still return valid information, it might not be the most optimal enumeration approach. In fact, to make our enumeration as accurate as possible, we should look for the DC that holds the most updated information. This is known as the [_Primary Domain Controller_](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-GB/troubleshoot/windows-server/identity/fsmo-roles) (PDC). There can be only one PDC in a domain. To find the PDC, we need to find the DC holding the _PdcRoleOwner_ property. We'll eventually use PowerShell and a specific .NET class to find this.

The _PortNumber_ for the LDAP connection is optional as per Microsoft's documentation. In our case we will not add the port number since it will automatically choose the port based on whether or not we are using an SSL connection. However, it is worth noting that if we come across a domain in the future using non-default ports, we may need to manually add this to the script.

Lastly, a [_DistinguishedName_](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/previous-versions/windows/desktop/ldap/distinguished-names) (DN) is a part of the LDAP path. A DN is a name that uniquely identifies an object in AD, including the domain itself. If we aren't familiar with LDAP, this may be somewhat confusing so let's go into a bit more detail.

For LDAP to function, objects in AD (or other directory services) must be formatted according to a specific [naming standard](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc2247.html). To show an example of a DN, we can use our _stephanie_ domain user. We know that _stephanie_ is a user object within the _corp.com_ domain. With this, the DN may (although we cannot be sure yet) look something like this:

```
CN=Stephanie,CN=Users,DC=corp,DC=com
```

> Listing 7 - Example of a Distinguished Name

The Listing above shows a few new references we haven't seen earlier in this Module, such as _CN_ and _DC_. The CN is known as the _Common Name_, which specifies the identifier of an object in the domain. While we normally refer to "DC" as the Domain Controller in AD terms, "DC" means _Domain Component_ when we are referring to a Distinguished Name. The _Domain Component_ represents the top of an LDAP tree and in this case, we refer to it as the Distinguished Name of the domain itself.

When reading a DN, we start with the Domain Component objects on the right side and move to the left. In the example above, we have four components, starting with two components named _DC=corp,DC=com_. The Domain Component objects as mentioned above represent the top of an LDAP tree following the required naming standard.

Continuing through the DN, _CN=Users_ represents the Common Name for the container where the user object is stored (also known as the parent container). Finally, all the way to the left, _CN=Stephanie_ represents the Common Name for the user object itself, which is also lowest in the hierarchy.

In our case for the LDAP path, we are interested in the Domain Component object, which is _DC=corp,DC=com_. If we added _CN=Users_ to our LDAP path, we would restrict ourselves by only being able to search objects within that given container.

Let's begin writing our script by obtaining the required hostname for the PDC.

In the Microsoft [.NET classes](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/) related to AD, we find the _System.DirectoryServices.ActiveDirectory_ namespace. While there are a few classes to choose from here, we'll focus on the [_Domain Class_](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.directoryservices.activedirectory.domain?view=windowsdesktop-7.0). It specifically contains a reference to the _PdcRoleOwner_ in the properties, which is exactly what we need. By checking the methods, we find a method called _GetCurrentDomain()_, which will return the domain object for the current user, in this case _stephanie_.

To invoke the _Domain Class_ and the _GetCurrentDomain_ method, we'll run the following command in PowerShell:

```
PS C:\Users\stephanie> [System.DirectoryServices.ActiveDirectory.Domain]::GetCurrentDomain()

Forest                  : corp.com
DomainControllers       : {DC1.corp.com}
Children                : {}
DomainMode              : Unknown
DomainModeLevel         : 7
Parent                  :
PdcRoleOwner        : DC1.corp.com
RidRoleOwner            : DC1.corp.com
InfrastructureRoleOwner : DC1.corp.com
Name                  	: corp.com
```

> Listing 8 - Domain class from System.DirectoryServices.ActiveDirectory namespace

The output reveals the _PdcRoleOwner_ property, which in this case is _DC1.corp.com_. While we can certainly add this hostname directly into our script as part of the LDAP path, we want to automate the process so we can also use this script in future engagements.

Let's do this one step at a time. First, we'll create a variable that will store the domain object, then we will print the variable so we can verify that it still works within our script. The first part of our script is listed below:

```
# Store the domain object in the $domainObj variable
$domainObj = [System.DirectoryServices.ActiveDirectory.Domain]::GetCurrentDomain()

# Print the variable
$domainObj
```

> Listing 9 - Storing domain object in our first variable

To run the script, we must bypass the execution policy, which was designed to keep us from accidentally running PowerShell scripts. We'll do this with **powershell -ep bypass**:

```
PS C:\Users\stephanie> powershell -ep bypass
Windows PowerShell
Copyright (C) Microsoft Corporation. All rights reserved.

Install the latest PowerShell for new features and improvements! https://aka.ms/PSWindows

PS C:\Users\stephanie>
```

Now let's run our script and verify that it prints the domain object:

```
PS C:\Users\stephanie> .\enumeration.ps1

Forest                  : corp.com
DomainControllers       : {DC1.corp.com}
Children                : {}
DomainMode              : Unknown
DomainModeLevel         : 7
Parent                  :
PdcRoleOwner            : DC1.corp.com
RidRoleOwner            : DC1.corp.com
InfrastructureRoleOwner : DC1.corp.com
Name                    : corp.com
```

> Listing 10 - Output displaying information stored in our first variable

Our _domainObj_ variable now holds the information about the domain object. Although this print statement isn't required, it's a nice way to verify that our command and the variable worked as intended.

Since the hostname in the _PdcRoleOwner_ property is required for our LDAP path, we can extract the name directly from the domain object. In case we need more information from the domain object later in our script, we will keep the _$domainObj_ for the time being and create a new variable called _$PDC_, which will extract the value from the _PdcRoleOwner_ property held in our _$domainObj_ variable:

```
# Store the domain object in the $domainObj variable
$domainObj = [System.DirectoryServices.ActiveDirectory.Domain]::GetCurrentDomain()

# Store the PdcRoleOwner name to the $PDC variable
$PDC = $domainObj.PdcRoleOwner.Name

# Print the $PDC variable
$PDC
```

> Listing 11 - Adding the $PDC variable to our script and extracting PdcRoleOwner name to it

Now let's run the script again and inspect the output:

```
PS C:\Users\stephanie> .\enumeration.ps1
DC1.corp.com
```

> Listing 12 - Printing the $PDC variable

In this case we have dynamically extracted the PDC from the _PdcRoleOwner_ property by using the Domain Class. Good.

While we can also get the DN for the domain via the domain object, it does not follow the naming standard required by LDAP. In our example, we know that the base domain is _corp.com_ and the DN would in fact be _DC=corp,DC=com_. In this instance, we could grab _corp.com_ from the _Name_ property in the domain object and tell PowerShell to break it up and add the required _DC=_ parameter. However, there is an easier way of doing it, which will also make sure we are obtaining the correct DN.

We can use ADSI directly in PowerShell to retrieve the DN. We'll use two single quotes to indicate that the search starts at the top of the AD hierarchy.

```
PS C:\Users\stephanie> ([adsi]'').distinguishedName
DC=corp,DC=com
```

> Listing 13 - Using ADSI to obtain the DN for the domain

This returns the DN in the proper format for the LDAP path.

Now we can add a new variable in our script that will store the DN for the domain. To make sure the script still works, we'll add a _print_ statement and print the contents of our new variable:

```
# Store the domain object in the $domainObj variable
$domainObj = [System.DirectoryServices.ActiveDirectory.Domain]::GetCurrentDomain()

# Store the PdcRoleOwner name to the $PDC variable
$PDC = $domainObj.PdcRoleOwner.Name

# Store the Distinguished Name variable into the $DN variable
$DN = ([adsi]'').distinguishedName

# Print the $DN variable
$DN
```

> Listing 14 - Creating a new variable holding the DN for the domain

Let's run the script.

```
PS C:\Users\stephanie> .\enumeration.ps1
DC=corp,DC=com
```

> Listing 15 - Using our script to print the DN of the domain

At this point, we are dynamically obtaining the Hostname and the DN with our script. Now we must assemble the pieces to build the full LDAP path. To do this, we'll add a new _$LDAP_ variable to our script that will contain the _$PDC_ and _$DN_ variables, prefixed with "LDAP://".

The final script generates the LDAP shown below. Note that to clean it up, we have removed the comments. Since we only needed the _PdcRoleOwner_ property's name value from the domain object, we add that directly in our _$PDC_ variable on the first line, limiting the amount of code required:

```
$PDC = [System.DirectoryServices.ActiveDirectory.Domain]::GetCurrentDomain().PdcRoleOwner.Name
$DN = ([adsi]'').distinguishedName 
$LDAP = "LDAP://$PDC/$DN"
$LDAP
```

> Listing 16 - Script which will create the full LDAP path required for enumeration

Let's run the script.

```
PS C:\Users\stephanie> .\enumeration.ps1
LDAP://DC1.corp.com/DC=corp,DC=com
```

> Listing 17 - Script output showing the full LDAP path

Great! We have successfully used .NET classes and ADSI to dynamically obtain the full LDAP path required for our enumeration. Also, our script is dynamic, so we can easily reuse it in real-world engagements.

## 22.2.3. Adding Search Functionality to our Script

So far, our script builds the required LDAP path. Now we can build in search functionality.

To do this, we will use two .NET classes that are located in the _System.DirectoryServices_ namespace, more specifically the [_DirectoryEntry_](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.directoryservices.directoryentry?view=dotnet-plat-ext-6.0) and [_DirectorySearcher_](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.directoryservices.directorysearcher?view=dotnet-plat-ext-6.0) classes. Let's discuss these before we implement them.

The _DirectoryEntry_ class encapsulates an object in the AD service hierarchy. In our case, we want to search from the very top of the AD hierarchy, so we will provide the obtained LDAP path to the _DirectoryEntry_ class.

One thing to note with _DirectoryEntry_ is that we can pass it credentials to authenticate to the domain. However, since we are already logged in, there is no need to do that here.

The _DirectorySearcher_ class performs queries against AD using LDAP. When creating an instance of _DirectorySearcher_, we must specify the AD service we want to query in the form of the [_SearchRoot_](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.directoryservices.directorysearcher.searchroot?view=dotnet-plat-ext-6.0) property. According to Microsoft's documentation, this property indicates where the search begins in the AD hierarchy. Since the _DirectoryEntry_ class encapsulates the LDAP path that points to the top of the hierarchy, we will pass that as a variable to _DirectorySearcher_.

The _DirectorySearcher_ documentation lists [_FindAll()_](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.directoryservices.directorysearcher.findall?view=dotnet-plat-ext-7.0#system-directoryservices-directorysearcher-findall), which returns a collection of all the entries found in AD.

Let's implement these two classes into our script. The code below shows the relevant part of the script:

```
$PDC = [System.DirectoryServices.ActiveDirectory.Domain]::GetCurrentDomain().PdcRoleOwner.Name
$DN = ([adsi]'').distinguishedName 
$LDAP = "LDAP://$PDC/$DN"

$direntry = New-Object System.DirectoryServices.DirectoryEntry($LDAP)

$dirsearcher = New-Object System.DirectoryServices.DirectorySearcher($direntry)
$dirsearcher.FindAll()
```

> Listing 18 - Directory and DirectorySearcher to our script

As indicated in Listing 18, we have added the _$direntry_ variable, which is encapsulating our obtained LDAP path. The _$dirsearcher_ variable contains the _$direntry_ variable and uses the information as the _SearchRoot_, pointing to the top of the hierarchy where _DirectorySearcher_ will run the _FindAll()_ method.

Now since we start the search at the top and aren't filtering the results, it will generate a lot of output. However, let's run it:

```
PS C:\Users\stephanie> .\enumeration.ps1

> Listing 19 - Using our script to search AD

As shown in the truncated output of Listing 19, the script does indeed generate a lot of text. In fact, we are receiving all objects in the entire domain. This does at least prove that the script is working as expected.

Filtering the output is rather simple, and there are several ways to do so. One way is to set up a filter that will sift through the [_samAccountType_](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/adschema/a-samaccounttype) attribute, which is an attribute applied to all user, computer, and group objects.

The official documentation reveals different values of the _samAccountType_ attribute, but we'll start with 0x30000000 (decimal 805306368), which will enumerate all users in the domain. To implement the filter in our script, we can simply add the filter to the **$dirsearcher.filter** as shown below:

```
$PDC = [System.DirectoryServices.ActiveDirectory.Domain]::GetCurrentDomain().PdcRoleOwner.Name
$DN = ([adsi]'').distinguishedName 
$LDAP = "LDAP://$PDC/$DN"

$direntry = New-Object System.DirectoryServices.DirectoryEntry($LDAP)

$dirsearcher = New-Object System.DirectoryServices.DirectorySearcher($direntry)
$dirsearcher.filter="samAccountType=805306368"
$dirsearcher.FindAll()
```

> Listing 20 - Using samAccountType attribute to filter normal user accounts

Running our script displays all user objects in the domain:

```
PS C:\Users\stephanie> .\enumeration.ps1

```

> Listing 21 - Receiving all users in the domain filtering on samAccountType

This is great information to have, but we need to develop it a little further. When enumerating AD, we are very interested in the _attributes_ of each object, which are stored in the _Properties_ field.

Knowing this, we can store the results we receive from our search in a new variable. We'll iterate through each object and print each property on its own line via a nested loop as shown below.

```
$domainObj = [System.DirectoryServices.ActiveDirectory.Domain]::GetCurrentDomain()
$PDC = $domainObj.PdcRoleOwner.Name
$DN = ([adsi]'').distinguishedName 
$LDAP = "LDAP://$PDC/$DN"

$direntry = New-Object System.DirectoryServices.DirectoryEntry($LDAP)

$dirsearcher = New-Object System.DirectoryServices.DirectorySearcher($direntry)
$dirsearcher.filter="samAccountType=805306368"
$result = $dirsearcher.FindAll()

Foreach($obj in $result)
{
    Foreach($prop in $obj.Properties)
    {
        $prop
    }

    Write-Host "-------------------------------"
}
```

> Listing 22 - Adding a nested loop which will print each property on its own line

This complete script will search through AD and filter the results based on the _samAccountType_ of our choosing, then place the results into the new _$result_ variable. It will then further filter the results based on two _foreach_ loops. The first loop will extract the objects stored in _$result_ and place them into the _$obj_ variable. The second loop will extract all the properties for each object and store the information in the _$prop_ variable. The script will then print _$prop_ and present the output in the terminal.

While the _Write-Host_ command is not required for the script to function, it does print a line between each object. This helps make the output somewhat easier to read.

The script will output lots of information, which can be overwhelming depending on the existing number of domain users. The Listing below shows a partial view of _jeffadmin_'s attributes:

> Listing 23 - Running script, printing each attribute for "jeffadmin"

We can filter based on any property of any object type. In the example below, we have made two changes. First, we have changed the filter to use the _name_ property to only show information for _jeffadmin_. Additionally, we have added _.memberof_ to the _$prop_ variable to only display the groups _jeffadmin_ is a member of:

```
$dirsearcher = New-Object System.DirectoryServices.DirectorySearcher($direntry)
$dirsearcher.filter="name=jeffadmin"
$result = $dirsearcher.FindAll()

Foreach($obj in $result)
{
    Foreach($prop in $obj.Properties)
    {
        $prop.memberof
    }

    Write-Host "-------------------------------"
}
```

> Listing 24 - Adding the name property to the filter and only print the "memberof" attribute in the nested loop

Let's run the script:

```
PS C:\Users\stephanie> .\enumeration.ps1
CN=Domain Admins,CN=Users,DC=corp,DC=com
CN=Administrators,CN=Builtin,DC=corp,DC=com
```

> Listing 25 - Running script to only show jeffadmin and which groups he is a member of

This confirms that _jeffadmin_ is indeed a member of the _Domain Admins_ group.

We can use this script to enumerate any object available to us in AD. However, in the current state, this would require us to make further edits to the script itself based on what we wish to enumerate.

Instead, we can make the script more flexible, allowing us to add the required parameters via the command line. For example, we could have the script accept the _samAccountType_ we wish to enumerate as a command line argument.

There are many ways we can accomplish this. One way is to simply encapsulate the current functionality of the script into an actual function. An example of this is shown below.

```
function LDAPSearch {
    param (
        [string]$LDAPQuery
    )

    $PDC = [System.DirectoryServices.ActiveDirectory.Domain]::GetCurrentDomain().PdcRoleOwner.Name
    $DistinguishedName = ([adsi]'').distinguishedName

    $DirectoryEntry = New-Object System.DirectoryServices.DirectoryEntry("LDAP://$PDC/$DistinguishedName")

    $DirectorySearcher = New-Object System.DirectoryServices.DirectorySearcher($DirectoryEntry, $LDAPQuery)

    return $DirectorySearcher.FindAll()

}
```

> Listing 26 - A function that accepts user input

At the very top, we declare the function itself with the name of our choosing, in this case _LDAPSearch_. It then dynamically obtains the required LDAP path connection string and adds it to the _$DirectoryEntry_ variable.

Afterwards, the _DirectoryEntry_ and our _$LDAPQuery_ parameter is fed into the _DirectorySearcher_. Finally, the search is run, and the output is added into an array, which is displayed in our terminal depending on our needs.

To use the function, let's import it to memory:

```
PS C:\Users\stephanie> Import-Module .\function.ps1
```

> Listing 27 - Importing our function to memory

Within PowerShell, we can now use the **LDAPSearch** command (our declared function name) to obtain information from AD. To repeat parts of the user enumeration we did earlier, we can again filter on the specific _samAccountType_:

```
PS C:\Users\stephanie> LDAPSearch -LDAPQuery "(samAccountType=805306368)"

Path                                                         Properties

```

> Listing 28 - Performing a user search using the new function

We can also search directly for an _Object Class_, which is a component of AD that defines the object type. Let's use **objectClass=group** in this case to list all the groups in the domain:

```
PS C:\Users\stephanie> LDAPSearch -LDAPQuery "(objectclass=group)"

...                                                                                 ----------

```

> Listing 29 - Searching all possible groups in AD

Our script enumerates more groups than net.exe including _Print Operators_, _IIS_IUSRS_, and others. This is because it enumerates all AD objects including _Domain Local_ groups (not just global groups).

To print properties and attributes for objects, we'll need to implement the loops we discussed earlier. For now, let's do this directly from the PowerShell command.

To enumerate every group available in the domain and display the user members, we can pipe the output into a new variable and use a _foreach_ loop that will print each property for a group. This allows us to select specific attributes we are interested in. For example, let's focus on the _CN_ and _member_ attributes:

```
PS C:\Users\stephanie\Desktop> foreach ($group in $(LDAPSearch -LDAPQuery "(objectCategory=group)")) {
>> $group.properties | select {$_.cn}, {$_.member}
>> }
```

> Listing 30 - Using "foreach" to iterate through the objects in $group variable

Even though this environment is somewhat small, we still received a lot of output. Let's focus on the three groups we noticed earlier in our enumeration with net.exe:

```
...
Sales Department              {CN=Development Department,DC=corp,DC=com, CN=pete,CN=Users,DC=corp,DC=com, CN=stephanie,CN=Users,DC=corp,DC=com}
Management Department         CN=jen,CN=Users,DC=corp,DC=com
Development Department        {CN=Management Department,DC=corp,DC=com, CN=pete,CN=Users,DC=corp,DC=com, CN=dave,CN=Users,DC=corp,DC=com}
...
```

> Listing 31 - Partial output from our previous search

According to our search, we have expanded the properties for each object, in this case the _group_ objects, and we printed the _member_ attribute for each group.

Listing 31 reveals something unexpected. Earlier when we enumerated the _Sales Department_ group with net.exe, we only found two users in it: _pete_ and _stephanie_. In this case however, it appears that _Development Department_ is also a member.

Since the output can be somewhat difficult to read, let's once again search for the groups, but this time specify the _Sales Department_ in the query and pipe it into a variable in our PowerShell command line:

```
PS C:\Users\stephanie> $sales = LDAPSearch -LDAPQuery "(&(objectCategory=group)(cn=Sales Department))"
```

> Listing 32 - Adding the search to our variable called $sales

Now that we only have one object in our variable, we can simply print the _member_ attribute directly:

```
PS C:\Users\stephanie\Desktop> $sales.properties.member
CN=Development Department,DC=corp,DC=com
CN=pete,CN=Users,DC=corp,DC=com
CN=stephanie,CN=Users,DC=corp,DC=com
PS C:\Users\stephanie\Desktop>
```

> Listing 33 - Printing the member attribute on the Sales Department group object

The _Development Department_ is indeed a member of the _Sales Department_ group as indicated in Listing 33. This is something we missed earlier with net.exe.

This is a group within a group, known as a _nested group_. Nested groups are relatively common in AD and scales well, allowing flexibility and dynamic membership customization of even the largest AD implementations.

The net.exe tool missed this because it only lists _user_ objects, not group objects.

In addition, net.exe cannot display specific attributes. This emphasizes the benefit of custom tools.

Now that we know the _Development Department_ is a member of the _Sales Department_, let's enumerate it:

```
PS C:\Users\stephanie> $group = LDAPSearch -LDAPQuery "(&(objectCategory=group)(cn=Development Department*))"

PS C:\Users\stephanie> $group.properties.member
CN=Management Department,DC=corp,DC=com
CN=pete,CN=Users,DC=corp,DC=com
CN=dave,CN=Users,DC=corp,DC=com
```

> Listing 34 - Printing the member attribute on the Development Department group object

Based on the output above, we have another case of a nested group since _Management Department_ is a member of _Development Department_. Let's check this group as well:

```
PS C:\Users\stephanie\Desktop> $group = LDAPSearch -LDAPQuery "(&(objectCategory=group)(cn=Management Department*))"

PS C:\Users\stephanie\Desktop> $group.properties.member
CN=jen,CN=Users,DC=corp,DC=com
```

> Listing 35 - Printing the member attribute on the Management Department group object

Finally, after searching through multiple groups, it appears we found the end. According to the output in Listing 35, _jen_ is the sole member of the _Management Department_ group. Although we saw _jen_ as a member of the _Management Department_ group earlier in Listing 31, we obtained additional information about the group memberships in this case by enumerating the groups one-by-one.

An additional thing to note here is that while it appears that _jen_ is only a part of the _Management Department_ group, she is also an indirect member of the _Sales Department_ and _Development Department_ groups, since groups typically inherit each other. This is normal behavior in AD; however, if misconfigured, users may end up with more privileges than they were intended to have. This might allow attackers to take advantage of the misconfiguration to further expand their reach inside the compromised domain.

This concludes the journey with our PowerShell script that invokes .NET classes to run queries against AD via LDAP. As we have verified, this approach is much more powerful than running tools such as net.exe and provides a wealth of enumeration options.

While this script can surely be developed further by adding additional options and functions, this may require more research on PowerShell scripting, which is outside the scope of this Module.

With a basic understanding of LDAP and how we can use it to communicate with AD using PowerShell, we'll shift our focus in the next section to a pre-developed script that will speed up our process.

## 22.2.4. AD Enumeration with PowerView

So far, we have only scratched the surface of Active Directory enumeration by mostly focusing on users and groups. While the tools we have used so far have given us a good start and an understanding of how we can communicate with AD and obtain information, other researchers have created more elaborate tools for the same purpose.

One popular option is the [_PowerView_](https://powersploit.readthedocs.io/en/latest/Recon/) PowerShell script, which includes many functions to improve the effectiveness of our enumeration.

As a way of introducing PowerView, let's walk through parts of our enumeration steps from the previous section. PowerView is already installed in the **C:\Tools** folder on CLIENT75. To use it, we'll first import it to memory:

```
PS C:\Tools> Import-Module .\PowerView.ps1
```

> Listing 36 - Importing PowerView to memory

With PowerView imported, we can start exploring various commands that are available. For a list of available commands in PowerView, please refer to the [linked reference](https://powersploit.readthedocs.io/en/latest/Recon/).

Let's start by running **Get-NetDomain**, which will give us basic information about the domain (which we used _GetCurrentDomain_ for previously):

```
PS C:\Tools> Get-NetDomain

> Listing 37 - Obtaining domain information

Much like the script we created earlier, PowerView is also using .NET classes to obtain the required LDAP path and uses it to communicate with AD.

Now let's get a list of all users in the domain with **Get-NetUser**:

```
PS C:\Tools> Get-NetUser

logoncount             : 113

```

> Listing 38 - Querying users in the domain

Get-NetUser automatically enumerates all attributes on the user objects. This presents a lot of information, which can be difficult to digest.

In the script we created earlier, we used loops to print certain attributes based on the information obtained. However, with PowerView we can simply pipe the output into **select**, where we can choose the attributes, we are interested in.

The output from Listing 38 reveals that the _cn_ attribute holds the username of the user. Let's pipe the output into **select** and choose the **cn** attribute:

```
PS C:\Tools> Get-NetUser | select cn

cn
--
Administrator
Guest
krbtgt
dave
stephanie
jeff
jeffadmin
iis_service
pete
jen
```

> Listing 39 - Querying users using select statement

This produced a cleaned-up list of users in the domain.

When enumerating AD, there are many interesting attributes to search for. For example, if a user is dormant (they have not changed their password or logged in recently) we will cause less interference and draw less attention if we take over that account during the engagement. In addition, if a user hasn't changed their password since a recent password policy change, their password may be weaker than the current policy. This might make it more vulnerable to password attacks.

This is something we can easily investigate. Let's run **Get-NetUser** again, this time piping the output into **select** and extracting these attributes.

```
PS C:\Tools> Get-NetUser | select cn,pwdlastset,lastlogon

cn            pwdlastset            lastlogon
--            ----------            ---------

```

> Listing 40 - Querying users displaying pwdlastset and lastlogon

As indicated in Listing 40, we have a nice list which shows us when the users last changed their password, as well as when they last logged in to the domain.

Similarly, we can use **Get-NetGroup** to enumerate groups:

```
PS C:\Tools> Get-NetGroup | select cn

cn
--
...
Key Admins
Enterprise Key Admins
DnsAdmins
DnsUpdateProxy
Sales Department
Management Department
Development Department
Debug
```

> Listing 41 - Querying groups in the domain using PowerView

Enumerating specific groups with PowerView is easy. Although we will not go through the process of unraveling nested groups in this case, let's investigate the **Sales Department** using **Get-NetGroup** and pipe the output into **select member**:

```
PS C:\Tools> Get-NetGroup "Sales Department" | select member

member
------
{CN=Development Department,DC=corp,DC=com, CN=pete,CN=Users,DC=corp,DC=com, CN=stephanie,CN=Users,DC=corp,DC=com}
```

> Listing 42 - Enumerating the "Sales Department" group

Now that we have essentially recreated the functionality of our previous script, we're ready to explore more attributes and enumeration techniques.

## 22.3. Manual Enumeration - Expanding our Repertoire

This Learning Unit covers the following Learning Objectives:

- Enumerate Operating Systems
- Enumerate permissions and logged on users
- Enumerate through Service Principal Names
- Enumerate Object Permissions
- Explore Domain Shares

Now that we are familiar with LDAP and we have a few tools in our toolkit, let's further explore the domain.

Our goal is to use all this information to create a _domain map_. While we don't necessarily need to draw a map ourselves, it is a good idea to try visualizing how the domain is configured and understand the relationship between objects. Visualizing the environment can make it easier to find potential attack vectors.

## 22.3.1. Enumerating Operating Systems

In a typical penetration test, we use various recon tools to detect which operating system a client or server is using. We can, however, enumerate this from Active Directory.

Let's use the **Get-NetComputer** PowerView command to enumerate the computer objects in the domain.

```
PS C:\Tools> Get-NetComputer

```

> Listing 43 - Partial domain computer overview

There are many interesting attributes, but for now we'll search for the operating system and hostnames. Let's pipe the output into **select** and clean up our list.

```
PS C:\Tools> Get-NetComputer | select operatingsystem,dnshostname

operatingsystem              dnshostname
---------------              -----------
Windows Server 2022 Standard DC1.corp.com
Windows Server 2022 Standard web04.corp.com
Windows Server 2022 Standard FILES04.corp.com
Windows 11 Pro               client74.corp.com
Windows 11 Pro               client75.corp.com
Windows 10 Pro               CLIENT76.corp.com
```

> Listing 44 - Displaying OS and hostname

The output reveals a total of six computers in this domain, three of which are servers, including one DC.

It's a good idea to grab this information early in the assessment to determine the relative age of the systems and to locate potentially weak targets. According to the information we've gathered so far, the machine with the oldest OS appears to be running Windows 10. Additionally, it appears we are dealing with a web server and a file server that will require our attention at some point as well.

So far in our enumeration we have obtained a nice list of all objects in the domain as well as their attributes. In the next section, we will continue using this information to determine the relationships between the various objects in search of potential attack vectors.

## 22.3.2. Getting an Overview - Permissions and Logged on Users

Now that we have a clear list of computers, users, and groups in the domain, we will continue our enumeration and focus on the relationships between as many objects as possible. These relationships often play a key role during an attack, and our goal is to build a _map_ of the domain to find potential attack vectors.

For example, when a user logs in to the domain, their credentials are cached in memory on the computer they logged in from.

If we can steal those credentials, we may be able to use them to authenticate as the domain user and may even escalate our domain privileges.

However, during an AD assessment, we may not always want to escalate our privileges right away.

Instead, it's important to establish a good foothold, and our goal at the very least should be to maintain our access. If we are able to compromise other users that have the same permissions as the user, we already have access to, this allows us to maintain our foothold. If, for example, the password is reset for the user we originally obtained access to, or the system administrators notice suspicious activity and disable the account, we would still have access to the domain via other users we compromised.

When the time comes to escalate our privileges, we don't necessarily need to immediately escalate to _Domain Admins_ because there may be other accounts that have higher privileges than a regular domain user, even if they aren't necessarily a part of the _Domain Admins_ group. _Service Accounts_, which we will discuss later, are a good example of this. Although they may not always have the highest privilege possible, they may have more permissions than a regular domain user, such as local administrator privileges on specific servers.

In addition, an organization's most sensitive and important data may be stored in locations that do not require domain administrator privileges, such as a database or a file server. This means that obtaining domain administrator privileges should not always be the end goal during an assessment since we may be able to reach the "crown jewels" for an organization via other users in the domain.

Nevertheless, in our Challenge Labs the goal is to achieve domain administrator privileges.

When an attacker or penetration tester improves access through multiple higher-level accounts to reach a goal, it is known as a _chained compromise_.

To find possible attack paths, we'll need to learn more about our initial user and see what else we have access to in the domain. We also need to find out where other users are logged in. Let's dig into that now.

PowerView's _Find-LocalAdminAccess_ command scans the network to determine if our current user has administrative permissions on any computers in the domain. The command relies on the [_OpenServiceW function_](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/api/winsvc/nf-winsvc-openservicew), which will connect to the _Service Control Manager_ (SCM) on the target machines. The SCM essentially maintains a database of installed services and drivers on Windows computers. PowerView will attempt to open this database with the _SC_MANAGER_ALL_ACCESS_ access right, which require administrative privileges, and if the connection is successful, PowerView will deem that our current user has administrative privileges on the target machine.

Let's run **Find-LocalAdminAccess** against _corp.com_. While the command supports parameters such as _Computername_ and _Credentials_, we will run it without parameters in this case since we are interested in enumerating all computers, and we are already logged in as _stephanie_. In other words, we are _spraying_ the environment to find possible local administrative access on computers under the current user context.

Depending on the size of the environment, it may take a few minutes for Find-LocalAdminAccess to finish.

```
PS C:\Tools> Find-LocalAdminAccess
client74.corp.com
```

> Listing 45 - Scanning domain to find local administrative privileges for our user

This reveals that _stephanie_ has administrative privileges on CLIENT74. While it may be tempting to log in to CLIENT74 and check permissions right away, this is a good opportunity to zoom out and generalize.

Penetration testing can lead us in many different directions and while we should follow up on the many different paths based on our interactions, we should stick to our schedule/plan most of the time to keep a disciplined approach.

Let's continue by trying to visualize how computers and users are connected. The first step in this process will be to obtain information such as which user is logged in to which computer.

Historically, the two most reliable Windows APIs that could (and still may) help us achieve these goals are [_NetWkstaUserEnum_](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/api/lmwksta/nf-lmwksta-netwkstauserenum) and [_NetSessionEnum_](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/api/lmshare/nf-lmshare-netsessionenum). The former requires administrative privileges, while the latter does not. However, Windows has undergone changes over the last couple of years, possibly making the discovery of logged in user enumeration more difficult for us.

PowerView's **Get-NetSession** command uses the _NetWkstaUserEnum_ and _NetSessionEnum_ APIs under the hood. Let's try running it against some of the machines in the domain and see if we can find any logged in users:

```
PS C:\Tools> Get-NetSession -ComputerName files04

PS C:\Tools> Get-NetSession -ComputerName web04
PS C:\Tools>
```

> Listing 46 - Checking logged on users with Get-NetSession

As indicated above, we are not receiving any output. A simple explanation would be that there are no users logged in on the machines. However, to make sure we aren't receiving any error messages, let's add the **-Verbose** flag:

```
PS C:\Tools> Get-NetSession -ComputerName files04 -Verbose
VERBOSE: [Get-NetSession] Error: Access is denied

PS C:\Tools> Get-NetSession -ComputerName web04 -Verbose
VERBOSE: [Get-NetSession] Error: Access is denied
```

> Listing 47 - Adding verbosity to our Get-NetSession command

Unfortunately, it appears that _NetSessionEnum_ does not work in this case and returns an "Access is denied" error message. This most likely means that we are not allowed to run the query, and based on the error message, it may have something to do with privileges.

Since we may have administrative privileges on CLIENT74 with _stephanie_, let's run **Get-NetSession** against that machine and inspect the output there as well:

```
PS C:\Tools> Get-NetSession -ComputerName client74

CName        : \\192.168.50.75
UserName     : stephanie
Time         : 8
IdleTime     : 0
ComputerName : client74
```

> Listing 48 - Running Get-NetSession on CLIENT74

We did receive some more information this time. However, looking closer at the output, the IP address in _CName_ (192.168.50.75) does not match the IP address for CLIENT74. In fact, it matches the IP address for our current machine, which is CLIENT75. Since we haven't spawned any sessions to CLIENT74, something appears to be off in this case as well.

In a real-world engagement, or even in the Challenge Labs, we might accept that enumerating sessions with PowerView does not work and try to use a different tool. However, let's use this as a learning opportunity and take a deeper dive into the _NetSessionEnum_ API and try to figure out exactly why it does not work in our case.

According to the documentation for [_NetSessionEnum_](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/api/lmshare/nf-lmshare-netsessionenum), there are five possible query levels: 0,1,2,10,502. Level 0 only returns the name of the computer establishing the session. Levels 1 and 2 return more information but require administrative privileges.

This leaves us with Levels 10 and 502. Both should return information such as the name of the computer and name of the user establishing the connection. By default, PowerView uses query level 10 with _NetSessionEnum_, which should give us the information we are interested in.

The permissions required to enumerate sessions with _NetSessionEnum_ are defined in the **SrvsvcSessionInfo** registry key, which is located in the **HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\LanmanServer\DefaultSecurity** hive.

We'll use the Windows 11 machine we are currently logged in on to check the permissions. Although it may have different permissions than the other machines in the environment, it may give us an idea of what is going on.

In order to view the permissions, we'll use the PowerShell [**Get-Acl**](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/module/microsoft.powershell.security/get-acl?view=powershell-7.3) cmdlet. This command will essentially retrieve the permissions for the object we define with the **-Path** flag and print them in our PowerShell prompt.

```
PS C:\Tools> Get-Acl -Path HKLM:SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\LanmanServer\DefaultSecurity\ | fl

Path   : Microsoft.PowerShell.Core\Registry::HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\LanmanServer\DefaultSecurity\
Owner  : NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM
Group  : NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM
Access : BUILTIN\Users Allow  ReadKey
         BUILTIN\Administrators Allow  FullControl
         NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM Allow  FullControl
         CREATOR OWNER Allow  FullControl
         APPLICATION PACKAGE AUTHORITY\ALL APPLICATION PACKAGES Allow  ReadKey
         S-1-15-3-1024-1065365936-1281604716-3511738428-1654721687-432734479-3232135806-4053264122-3456934681 Allow  ReadKey
```

> Listing 49 - Displaying permissions on the DefaultSecurity registry hive

The highlighted output in Listing 49 reveals the groups and users that have either _FullControl_ or _ReadKey_, meaning they can all read the **SrvsvcSessionInfo** key itself.

However, the _BUILTIN_ group, _NT AUTHORITY_ group, _CREATOR OWNER_ and _APPLICATION PACKAGE AUTHORITY_ are defined by the system, and do not allow _NetSessionEnum_ to enumerate this registry key from a remote standpoint.

The long string in the end of the output is, according to [Microsoft's documentation](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/troubleshoot/windows-server/windows-security/sids-not-resolve-into-friendly-names), a _capability SID_. In fact, the documentation refers to the exact SID in our output.

A capability SID is an _unforgeable_ token of authority that grants a Windows component or a Universal Windows Application access to various resources. However, it will not give us remote access to the registry key of interest.

In older Windows versions (which Microsoft does not specify), _Authenticated Users_ were allowed to access the registry hive and obtain information from the **SrvsvcSessionInfo** key. However, following the _least privilege_ principle, regular domain users should not be able to acquire this information within the domain, which is likely part of the reason the permissions for the registry hive changed as well. In this case, due to permissions, we can be certain that _NetSessionEnum_ will not be able to obtain this type of information on default Windows 11.

Now let's get a better sense of the operating system versions in use. We can do this with **Net-GetComputer**, this time including the **operatingsystemversion** attribute:

```
PS C:\Tools> Get-NetComputer | select dnshostname,operatingsystem,operatingsystemversion

dnshostname       operatingsystem              operatingsystemversion
-----------       ---------------              ----------------------
DC1.corp.com      Windows Server 2022 Standard 10.0 (20348)
web04.corp.com    Windows Server 2022 Standard 10.0 (20348)
FILES04.corp.com  Windows Server 2022 Standard 10.0 (20348)
client74.corp.com Windows 11 Pro               10.0 (22000)
client75.corp.com Windows 11 Pro               10.0 (22000)
CLIENT76.corp.com Windows 10 Pro               10.0 (16299)
```

> Listing 50 - Querying operating system and version

As we discovered earlier, Windows 10 is the oldest operating system in the environment, and based on the output above, it runs version 16299, otherwise known as [build 1709](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/uwp/whats-new/windows-10-build-16299).

While the documentation from Microsoft is not clear when they made a change to the **HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\LanmanServer\DefaultSecurity** registry hive, it appears to be around the release of this exact build. It also seems to affect all Windows Server operating systems since Windows Server 2019 build 1809. This creates an issue for us since we won't be able to use PowerView to build the domain map we had in mind.

Even though _NetSessionEnum_ does not work in this case, we should keep it in our toolkit since it's not uncommon to find older systems in real-world environments.

Fortunately there are other tools we can use, such as the [_PsLoggedOn_](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/sysinternals/downloads/psloggedon) application from the [_SysInternals Suite_](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/sysinternals/). The documentation states that PsLoggedOn will enumerate the registry keys under **HKEY_USERS** to retrieve the _security identifiers_ (SID) of logged-in users and convert the SIDs to usernames. PsLoggedOn will also use the _NetSessionEnum_ API to see who is logged on to the computer via resource shares.

One limitation, however, is that PsLoggedOn relies on the _Remote Registry_ service to scan the associated key. The Remote Registry service has not been enabled by default on Windows workstations since Windows 8, but system administrators may enable it for various administrative tasks, for backwards compatibility, or for installing monitoring/deployment tools, scripts, agents, etc.

It is also enabled by default on later Windows Server Operating Systems such as Server 2012 R2, 2016 (1607), 2019 (1809), and Server 2022 (21H2). If it is enabled, the service will stop after ten minutes of inactivity to save resources, but it will re-enable (with an _automatic trigger_) once we connect with PsLoggedOn.

With the theory out of the way for now, let's try to run PsLoggedOn against the computers we attempted to enumerate earlier, starting with FILES04 and WEB04. PsLoggedOn is in **C:\Tools\PSTools** on CLIENT75. To use it, we'll simply run it with the target hostname:

```
PS C:\Tools\PSTools> .\PsLoggedon.exe \\files04

PsLoggedon v1.35 - See who's logged on
Copyright (C) 2000-2016 Mark Russinovich
Sysinternals - www.sysinternals.com

Users logged on locally:
     <unknown time>             CORP\jeff
Unable to query resource logons
```

> Listing 51 - Using PsLoggedOn to see user logons at Files04

In this case, we discover that _jeff_ is logged in on FILES04 with his domain user account. This is great information, which suggests another potential attack vector. We'll make a note in our documentation.

Let's go ahead and enumerate WEB04 as well:

```
PS C:\Tools\PSTools> .\PsLoggedon.exe \\web04

PsLoggedon v1.35 - See who's logged on
Copyright (C) 2000-2016 Mark Russinovich
Sysinternals - www.sysinternals.com

No one is logged on locally.
Unable to query resource logons
```

> Listing 52 - Using PsLoggedOn to see user logons at Web04

According to the output, there are no users logged in on WEB04. This may be a false positive since we cannot know for sure that the Remote Registry service is running, but we didn't receive any error messages, which suggests the output is accurate. For now, we will simply have to trust our enumeration and accept that no users are logged in on the specific server.

As we discovered earlier in this section, it appears that we have administrative privileges on CLIENT74 via _stephanie_, so this is a machine of high interest, and we should enumerate possible sessions there as well. Let's do that now. For educational purposes, we have enabled the Remote Registry service on CLIENT74.

```
PS C:\Tools\PSTools> .\PsLoggedon.exe \\client74

PsLoggedon v1.35 - See who's logged on
Copyright (C) 2000-2016 Mark Russinovich
Sysinternals - www.sysinternals.com

Users logged on locally:
     <unknown time>             CORP\jeffadmin

Users logged on via resource shares:
     10/5/2022 1:33:32 AM       CORP\stephanie
```

> Listing 53 - Using PsLoggedOn to see user logons at CLIENT74

It appears _jeffadmin_ has an open session on CLIENT74, and the output reveals some very interesting pieces of information. If our enumeration is accurate and we in fact have administrative privileges on CLIENT74, we should be able to log in there and possibly steal _jeffadmin_'s credentials! It would be very tempting to try this immediately, but it's best practice to stay the course and continue our enumeration. After all, our goal is not to get a quick win, but rather to provide a thorough analysis.

Another interesting thing to note in the output is that _stephanie_ is logged on via resource shares. This is shown because PsLoggedOn also uses the _NetSessionEnum_ API, which in this case requires a logon to work. This may also explain why we saw a logon earlier for _stephanie_ while using PowerView.

This concludes the enumeration of our compromised user, including the enumeration of active sessions within the domain. Based on the information we have gathered; we have a very interesting attack path that may lead us all the way to domain administrator if pursued.

In the next section, we will continue our enumeration by focusing on a different type of user, more specifically _Service Accounts_.

## 22.3.3. Enumeration Through Service Principal Names

So far, we have obtained quite a bit of information, and we are starting to see how things are connected within the domain. To wrap up our discussion of user enumeration, we'll shift our focus to [_Service Accounts_](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/fundamentals/service-accounts-on-premises), which may also be members of high-privileged groups.

Applications must be executed in the context of an operating system user. If a user launches an application, that user account defines the context. However, services launched by the system itself run in the context of a _Service Account_.

In other words, isolated applications can use a set of predefined service accounts, such as [_LocalSystem_](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/services/localsystem-account), [_LocalService_](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/services/localservice-account), and [_NetworkService_](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/services/networkservice-account).

For more complex applications, a domain user account may be used to provide the needed context while still maintaining access to resources inside the domain.

When applications like [_Exchange_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_Exchange_Server), MS SQL, or _Internet Information Services_ (IIS) are integrated into AD, a unique service instance identifier known as [_Service Principal Name_](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/ad/service-principal-names) (SPN) associates a service to a specific service account in Active Directory.

[Managed Service Accounts](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-server/security/group-managed-service-accounts/group-managed-service-accounts-overview), introduced with Windows Server 2008 R2, were designed for complex applications, which require tighter integration with Active Directory.

Larger applications like MS SQL and Microsoft Exchange often required server redundancy when running to guarantee availability, but Managed Service Accounts did not support this. To remedy this, Group Managed Service Accounts were introduced with Windows Server 2012, but this requires that domain controllers run Windows Server 2012 or higher. Because of this, some organizations may still rely on basic Service Accounts.

We can obtain the IP address and port number of applications running on servers integrated with AD by simply enumerating all SPNs in the domain, meaning we don't need to run a broad port scan.

Since the information is registered and stored in AD, it is present on the domain controller. To obtain the data, we will again query the DC, this time searching for specific SPNs.

To enumerate SPNs in the domain, we have multiple options. In this case, we'll use **setspn.exe**, which is installed on Windows by default. We'll use **-L** to run against both servers and clients in the domain.

While we could iterate through the list of domain users, we previously discovered the _iis_service_ user. Let's start with that one:

```
c:\Tools>setspn -L iis_service
Registered ServicePrincipalNames for CN=iis_service,CN=Users,DC=corp,DC=com:
        HTTP/web04.corp.com
        HTTP/web04
        HTTP/web04.corp.com:80
```

> Listing 54 - Listing SPN linked to a certain user account

In the Listing above, an SPN is linked to the _iis_service_ account.

Another way of enumerating SPNs is to let PowerView enumerate all the accounts in the domain. To obtain a clear list of SPNs, we can pipe the output into **select** and choose the **samaccountname** and **serviceprincipalname** attributes:

```
PS C:\Tools> Get-NetUser -SPN | select samaccountname,serviceprincipalname

samaccountname serviceprincipalname
-------------- --------------------
krbtgt         kadmin/changepw
iis_service    {HTTP/web04.corp.com, HTTP/web04, HTTP/web04.corp.com:80}
```

> Listing 55 - Listing the SPN accounts in the domain

While we will explore the _krbtgt_ account in upcoming AD-related Modules, for now, we'll continue to focus on _iis service_. The _serviceprincipalname_ of this account is set to "HTTP/web04.corp.com, HTTP/web04, HTTP/web04.corp.com:80", which is indicative of a web server.

Let's attempt to resolve **web04.corp.com** with **nslookup**:

```
PS C:\Tools\> nslookup.exe web04.corp.com
Server:  UnKnown
Address:  192.168.50.70

Name:    web04.corp.com
Address:  192.168.50.72
```

> Listing 56 - Resolving the web04.corp.com name

From the result, it's clear that the hostname resolves to an internal IP address. If we browse this to this IP, we find a website that requires a login:

![Figure 1: Web04 Login](https://static.offsec.com/offsec-courses/PEN-200/imgs/ad_intro_enum/b2a4ee29cd973bb20105fc10c63b8cdc-login.png)

Figure 1: Web04 Login

Since these types of accounts are used to run services, we can assume that they have more privileges than regular domain user accounts. For now, we'll simply document that _iis_service_ has a linked SPN, which will be valuable for us in the upcoming AD-related Modules.

Active Directory Enumeration - Enumeration Through Service Principal Names - VM Group 1

1. Start VM Group 1 and log in to CLIENT75 as _stephanie_. Repeat the enumeration steps outlined in this section to enumerate the Service Account. What is the name of the unique service identifier that is used to associate to a specific service in Active Directory?

Answer

## 22.3.4. Enumerating Object Permissions

In this section, we will enumerate specific permissions that are associated with Active Directory objects. Although the technical details of those permissions are complex and out of scope of this Module, it's important that we discuss the basic principles before we start enumeration.

In short, an object in AD may have a set of permissions applied to it with multiple [_Access Control Entries_](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/secauthz/access-control-entries) (ACE). These ACEs make up the [_Access Control List_](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/secauthz/access-control-lists) (ACL). Each ACE defines whether access to the specific object is allowed or denied.

As a very basic example, let's say a domain user attempts to access a domain share (which is also an object). The targeted object, in this case the share, will then go through a validation check based on the ACL to determine if the user has permissions to the share. This ACL validation involves two main steps. To access the share, the user will send an _access token_, which consists of the user identity and permissions. The target object will then validate the token against the list of permissions (the ACL). If the ACL allows the user to access the share, access is granted. Otherwise, the request is denied.

AD includes a wealth of permission types that can be used to configure an [ACE](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.directoryservices.activedirectoryrights?view=netframework-4.7.2). However, from an attacker's standpoint, we are mainly interested in a few key permission types. Here's a list of the most interesting ones along with a description of the permissions they provide:

```
GenericAll: Full permissions on object
GenericWrite: Edit certain attributes on the object
WriteOwner: Change ownership of the object
WriteDACL: Edit ACE's applied to object
AllExtendedRights: Change password, reset password, etc.
ForceChangePassword: Password change for object
Self (Self-Membership): Add ourselves to for example a group
```

> Listing 57 - AD permission types

The [Microsoft documentation](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/secauthz/access-rights-and-access-masks) lists other permissions and describes each in more detail.

We can use **Get-ObjectAcl** to enumerate ACEs with PowerView. To get started, let's enumerate our own user to determine which ACEs are applied to it. We can do this by filtering on **-Identity**:

```
PS C:\Tools> Get-ObjectAcl -Identity stephanie

...
ObjectDN               : CN=stephanie,CN=Users,DC=corp,DC=com
ObjectSID              : S-1-5-21-1987370270-658905905-1781884369-1104
ActiveDirectoryRights  : ReadProperty
ObjectAceFlags         : ObjectAceTypePresent
ObjectAceType          : 4c164200-20c0-11d0-a768-00aa006e0529
InheritedObjectAceType : 00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000
BinaryLength           : 56
AceQualifier           : AccessAllowed
IsCallback             : False
OpaqueLength           : 0
AccessMask             : 16
SecurityIdentifier     : S-1-5-21-1987370270-658905905-1781884369-553
AceType                : AccessAllowedObject
AceFlags               : None
IsInherited            : False
InheritanceFlags       : None
PropagationFlags       : None
AuditFlags             : None
...
```

> Listing 58 - Running Get-ObjectAcl specifying our user

The amount of output may seem overwhelming since we enumerated every ACE that grants or denies some sort of permission to _stephanie_. While there are many properties that seem potentially useful, we are primarily interested in those highlighted in the truncated output of Listing 58.

The output lists two [_Security Identifiers_](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-server/identity/ad-ds/manage/understand-security-identifiers) (SID), unique values that represent an object in AD. The first (located in the highlighted _ObjectSID_ property) contains the value "S-1-5-21-1987370270-658905905-1781884369-1104", which is rather difficult to read. In order to make sense of the SID, we can use PowerView's **Convert-SidToName** command to convert it to an actual domain object name:

```
PS C:\Tools> Convert-SidToName S-1-5-21-1987370270-658905905-1781884369-1104
CORP\stephanie
```

> Listing 59 - Converting the ObjectISD into name

The conversion reveals that the SID in the _ObjectSID_ property belongs to the _stephanie_ user we are currently using. The _ActiveDirectoryRights_ property describes the type of permission applied to the object. To find out who has the _ReadProperty_ permission in this case, we need to convert the _SecurityIdentifier_ value.

Let's use PowerView to convert it into a name we can read:

```
PS C:\Tools> Convert-SidToName S-1-5-21-1987370270-658905905-1781884369-553
CORP\RAS and IAS Servers
```

> Listing 60 - Converting the SecurityIdentifier into name

According to PowerView, the SID in the _SecurityIdentifier_ property belongs to a default AD group named [_RAS and IAS Servers_](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-server/identity/ad-ds/manage/understand-security-groups#ras-and-ias-servers).

Taking this information together, the _RAS and IAS Servers_ group has _ReadProperty_ access rights to our user. While this is a common configuration in AD and likely won't give us an attack vector, we have used the example to make sense of the information we have obtained.

In short, we are interested in the _ActiveDirectoryRights_ and _SecurityIdentifier_ for each object we enumerate going forward.

The highest access permission we can have on an object is _GenericAll_. Although there are many other interesting ones as discussed previously in this section, we will use GenericAll as an example in this case.

We can continue to use **Get-ObjectAcl** and select only the properties we are interested in, namely _ActiveDirectoryRights_ and _SecurityIdentifier_. While the _ObjectSID_ is nice to have, we don't need it when we are enumerating specific objects in AD since it will only contain the SID for the object, we are in fact enumerating.

Although we should enumerate all objects the domain, let's start with the _Management Department_ group for now. We will check if any users have GenericAll permissions.

To generate clean and manageable output, we'll use the PowerShell **-eq** flag to filter the **ActiveDirectoryRights** property, only displaying the values that equal **GenericAll**. We'll then pipe the results into **select**, only displaying the **SecurityIdentifier** and **ActiveDirectoryRights** properties:

```
PS C:\Tools> Get-ObjectAcl -Identity "Management Department" | ? {$_.ActiveDirectoryRights -eq "GenericAll"} | select SecurityIdentifier,ActiveDirectoryRights

SecurityIdentifier                            ActiveDirectoryRights
------------------                            ---------------------
S-1-5-21-1987370270-658905905-1781884369-512             GenericAll
S-1-5-21-1987370270-658905905-1781884369-1104            GenericAll
S-1-5-32-548                                             GenericAll
S-1-5-18                                                 GenericAll
S-1-5-21-1987370270-658905905-1781884369-519             GenericAll
```

> Listing 61 - Enumerating ACLs for the Management Group

In this case, we have a total of five objects that have the GenericAll permission on the _Management Department_ object. To make sense of this, let's convert all the SIDs into actual names:

```
PS C:\Tools> "S-1-5-21-1987370270-658905905-1781884369-512","S-1-5-21-1987370270-658905905-1781884369-1104","S-1-5-32-548","S-1-5-18","S-1-5-21-1987370270-658905905-1781884369-519" | Convert-SidToName
CORP\Domain Admins
CORP\stephanie
BUILTIN\Account Operators
Local System
CORP\Enterprise Admins
```

> Listing 62 - Converting all SIDs that have GenericAll permission on the Management Group

The first SID belongs to the _Domain Admins_ group and the GenericAll permission comes as no surprise since _Domain Admins_ have the highest privilege possible in the domain. What's interesting, however, is to find _stephanie_ in this list. Typically, a regular domain user should not have GenericAll permissions on other objects in AD, so this may be a misconfiguration.

This finding is significant and indicates that _stephanie_ is a powerful account.

When we enumerated the _Management Group_, we discovered that _jen_ was its only member. As an experiment to show the power of misconfigured object permissions, let's try to use our permissions as _stephanie_ to add ourselves to this group with net.exe.

```
PS C:\Tools> net group "Management Department" stephanie /add /domain
The request will be processed at a domain controller for domain corp.com.

The command completed successfully.
```

> Listing 63 - Using "net.exe" to add ourselves to domain group

Based on the output, we should now be a member of the group. We can verify this with **Get-NetGroup**.

```
PS C:\Tools> Get-NetGroup "Management Department" | select member

member
------
{CN=jen,CN=Users,DC=corp,DC=com, CN=stephanie,CN=Users,DC=corp,DC=com}
```

> Listing 64 - Running "Get-NetGroup" to enumerate "Management Department"

This reveals that _jen_ is no longer the sole member of the group and that we have successfully added our _stephanie_ user in there as well.

Now that we have abused the GenericAll permission, let's use it to clean up after ourselves by removing our user from the group:

```
PS C:\Tools> net group "Management Department" stephanie /del /domain
The request will be processed at a domain controller for domain corp.com.

The command completed successfully.
```

> Listing 65 - Using "net.exe" to remove ourselves from domain group

Once again, we can use PowerView to verify that _jen_ is the sole member of the group:

```
PS C:\Tools> Get-NetGroup "Management Department" | select member

member
------
CN=jen,CN=Users,DC=corp,DC=com
```

> Listing 66 - Running "Get-NetGroup" to verify that our user is removed from domain group

Great, the cleanup was successful.

From a system administrator perspective, managing permissions in Active Directory can be a tough task, especially in complex environments. Weak permissions such as the one we saw here are often the go-to vectors for attackers since it can often help us escalate our privileges within the domain.

In this particular case, we enumerated the _Management Group_ object specifically and leveraged _stephanie's_ GenericAll to add our own user to the group. Although it didn't grant us additional domain privileges, this exercise demonstrated the process of discovering and abusing the vast array of permissions that we can leverage in real-world engagements.

## 22.3.5. Enumerating Domain Shares

To wrap up our manual enumeration discussion, we'll shift our focus to domain shares. Domain shares often contain critical information about the environment, which we can use to our advantage.

We'll use PowerView's **Find-DomainShare** function to find the shares in the domain. We could also add the _-CheckShareAccess_ flag to display shares only available to us. However, we'll skip this flag for now to return a full list, including shares we may target later. Note that it may take a few moments for PowerView to find the shares and list them.

```
PS C:\Tools> Find-DomainShare

> Listing 67 - Domain Share Query

Listing 67 reveals shares from three different servers and a few clients. Although some of these are default domain shares, we should investigate each of them in search of interesting information.

In this instance, we'll first focus on [**SYSVOL**](https://social.technet.microsoft.com/wiki/contents/articles/24160.active-directory-back-to-basics-sysvol.aspx), as it may include files and folders that reside on the domain controller itself. This share is typically used for various domain policies and scripts. By default, the **SYSVOL** folder is mapped to **%SystemRoot%\SYSVOL\Sysvol\domain-name** on the domain controller and every domain user has access to it.

> Listing 68 - Listing contents of the SYSVOL share

During an assessment, we should investigate every folder we discover in search of interesting items. For now, let's examine the **Policies** folder:

```
PS C:\Tools> ls \\dc1.corp.com\sysvol\corp.com\Policies\

    Directory: \\dc1.corp.com\sysvol\corp.com\Policies

```

> Listing 69 - Listing contents of the "SYSVOL\policies share"

All the folders are potentially interesting, but we'll explore **oldpolicy** first. Within it, as shown in Listing 70, we find a file named **old-policy-backup.xml**:

```
PS C:\Tools> cat \\dc1.corp.com\sysvol\corp.com\Policies\oldpolicy\old-policy-backup.xml

```

> Listing 70 - Checking contents of old-policy-backup.xml file

Due to the naming of the folder and the name of the file itself, it appears that this is an older domain policy file. This is a common artifact on domain shares as system administrators often forget them when implementing new policies. In this case, the XML file describes an old policy (helpful for learning more about the current policies) and an encrypted password for the local built-in Administrator account. The encrypted password could be extremely valuable for us.

Historically, system administrators often changed local workstation passwords through [_Group Policy Preferences_](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/previous-versions/windows/it-pro/windows-server-2012-r2-and-2012/dn581922\(v=ws.11\)) (GPP).

However, even though GPP-stored passwords are encrypted with AES-256, the private key for the encryption has been posted on [_MSDN_](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/openspecs/windows_protocols/ms-gppref/2c15cbf0-f086-4c74-8b70-1f2fa45dd4be?redirectedfrom=MSDN#endNote2). We can use this key to decrypt these encrypted passwords. In this case, we'll use the [**gpp-decrypt**](https://www.kali.org/tools/gpp-decrypt/) ruby script in Kali Linux that decrypts a given GPP encrypted string:

```
kali@kali:~$ gpp-decrypt "+bsY0V3d4/KgX3VJdO/vyepPfAN1zMFTiQDApgR92JE"
P@$$w0rd
```

> Listing 71 - Using gpp-decrypt to decrypt the password

As indicated in Listing 71, we successfully decrypted the password, and we will make a note of this in our documentation.

Listing 67 also revealed other shares of potential interest. Let's check out **docshare** on **FILES04.corp.com** (which is not a default share).

```
PS C:\Tools> ls \\FILES04\docshare

    Directory: \\FILES04\docshare

Mode                 LastWriteTime         Length Name
----                 -------------         ------ ----
d-----         9/21/2022   2:02 AM                docs
```

> Listing 72 - Listing the contents of docsare

Farther in the folder structure, we find a **do-not-share** folder that contains **start-email.txt**:

```
PS C:\Tools> ls \\FILES04\docshare\docs\do-not-share

    Directory: \\FILES04\docshare\docs\do-not-share

Mode                 LastWriteTime         Length Name
----                 -------------         ------ ----
-a----         9/21/2022   2:02 AM           1142 start-email.txt
```

> Listing 73 - Listing the contents of do-not-share

Although this is a very strange name for a folder that is in fact shared, let's check out the content of the file:

```
PS C:\Tools> cat \\FILES04\docshare\docs\do-not-share\start-email.txt
Hi Jeff,

We are excited to have you on the team here in Corp. As Pete mentioned, we have been without a system administrator
since Dennis left, and we are very happy to have you on board.

Pete mentioned that you had some issues logging in to your Corp account, so I'm sending this email to you on your personal address.

The username I'm sure you already know, but here you have the brand new auto generated password as well: HenchmanPutridBonbon11

As you may be aware, we are taking security more seriously now after the previous breach, so please change the password at first login.

Best Regards
Stephanie

...............

Hey Stephanie,

Thank you for the warm welcome. I heard about the previous breach and that Dennis left the company.

Fortunately he gave me a great deal of documentation to go through, although in paper format. I'm in the
process of digitalizing the documentation so we can all share the knowledge. For now, you can find it in
the shared folder on the file server.

Thank you for reminding me to change the password, I will do so at the earliest convenience.

Best regards
Jeff
```

> Listing 74 - Checking the "start-email.txt" file

According to the text in this file, _jeff_ stored an email with a possible cleartext password: _HenchmanPutridBonbon11_! Although the password may have been changed, we will make a note of it in our documentation. Between this password and the password, we discovered earlier, we're building a rough profile of the password policy used for both users and computers in the organization. We could use this to create specific wordlists that we can use for password guessing and brute force, if needed.

## 22.4. Active Directory - Automated Enumeration

This Learning Unit covers the following Learning Objectives:

- Collect domain data using SharpHound
- Analyze the data using BloodHound

As we've seen so far in this Module, our manual enumeration can be relatively time consuming and can generate a wealth of information that can be difficult to organize.

Although it is important to understand the concepts of manual enumeration, we can also leverage automated tools to speed up the enumeration process and quickly reveal possible attack paths, especially in large environments. Manual and automated tools each have their merits, and most professionals leverage a combination of the two in real-world engagements.

Some automated tools, like [_PingCastle_](https://www.pingcastle.com/),generate gorgeous reports although most require paid licenses for commercial use. In our case, we will focus on [_BloodHound_](https://support.bloodhoundenterprise.io/hc/en-us), an excellent free tool that's extremely useful for analyzing AD environments.

It's worth noting that automated tools generate a great deal of network traffic, and many administrators will likely recognize a spike in traffic as we run these tools.

## 22.4.1. Collecting Data with SharpHound

We'll use BloodHound in the next section to analyze, organize and present the data, and the companion data collection tool, [_SharpHound_](https://support.bloodhoundenterprise.io/hc/en-us/articles/17481151861019-SharpHound-Community-Edition) to collect the data. SharpHound is written in C# and uses Windows API functions and LDAP namespace functions like those we used manually in the previous sections. For example, SharpHound will attempt to use [_NetWkstaUserEnum_](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/api/lmwksta/nf-lmwksta-netwkstauserenum) and [_NetSessionEnum_](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/api/lmshare/nf-lmshare-netsessionenum) to enumerate logged-on sessions, just as we did earlier. It will also run queries against the Remote Registry service, which we also leveraged earlier.

It's often best to combine automatic and manual enumeration techniques when assessing Active Directory. Even though we could theoretically gather the same information with a manual approach, graphical relationships often reveal otherwise unnoticed attack paths.

Let's get SharpHound up and running.

SharpHound is available in a few different formats. We can compile it ourselves, use an already compiled executable, or use it as a PowerShell script.

In our case, we will use a PowerShell script. To use the most updated version we will not use the file that is in **C:\Tools** on CLIENT75. Instead, we will download the current zip file of [SharpHound](https://github.com/BloodHoundAD/SharpHound/releases) to our Kali machine. Next, we can extract the **Sharphound.ps1** file from the zip file and transfer it to the CLIENT75 machine. Once we have done that, we can open a PowerShell window and import the script to memory:

```
PS C:\Users\stephanie> cd .\Downloads\

PS C:\Users\stephanie\Downloads> powershell -ep bypass
Windows PowerShell
Copyright (C) Microsoft Corporation. All rights reserved.

Install the latest PowerShell for new features and improvements! https://aka.ms/PSWindows
PS C:\Users\stephanie\Downloads> Import-Module .\Sharphound.ps1
```

> Listing 75 - Importing the SharpHound script to memory

With SharpHound imported, we can now start collecting domain data. However, to run SharpHound, we must first run **Invoke-BloodHound**. This is not intuitive since we're only running SharpHound at this stage. Let's invoke **Get-Help** to learn more about this command.

```
PS C:\Users\stephanie\Downloads> Get-Help Invoke-BloodHound

> Listing 76 - Checking the SharpHound options

We'll begin with the [**-CollectionMethod**](https://bloodhound.readthedocs.io/en/latest/data-collection/sharphound-all-flags.html), which describes the various collection methods. In our case, we'll attempt to gather **All** data, which will perform all collection methods except for local group policies.

By default, SharpHound will gather the data in JSON files and automatically zip them for us. This makes it easy for us to transfer the file to Kali Linux later. We'll save this output file on our desktop, with a "corp audit" prefix as shown below:

```
PS C:\Users\stephanie\Downloads> Invoke-BloodHound -CollectionMethod All -OutputDirectory C:\Users\stephanie\Desktop\ -OutputPrefix "corp audit"
```

> Listing 77 - Running SharpHound to collect domain data

Note that the data collection may take a few moments to finish, depending on the size of the environment we are enumerating. Let's examine SharpHound's output:

> Listing 78 - SharpHound output

Based on the output in Listing 78, we scanned a total of 309 objects. This will obviously vary based on how many objects and sessions exist in the domain.

In this case, SharpHound essentially took a snapshot of the domain from the _stephanie_ user, and we should be able to analyze everything the user account has access to. The collected data is stored in the zip file located on our Desktop:

```
PS C:\Users\stephanie\Downloads> ls C:\Users\stephanie\Desktop\

    Directory: C:\Users\stephanie\Desktop


Mode                 LastWriteTime         Length Name

```

> Listing 79 - SharpHound generated files

We'll use this file in the next section as we analyze the data with BloodHound. Sharphound created the **bin** cache file to speed up data collection. This is not needed for our analysis and we can safely delete it.

One thing to note is that SharpHound also supports _looping_, which means that the collector will run cyclical queries of our choosing over a period. While the collection method we used above created a _snapshot_ over the domain, running it in a loop may gather additional data as the environment changes. The cache file speeds up the process. For example, if a user logged on after we collected a snapshot, we would have missed it in our analysis. We will not use the looping functionality, but we recommend experimenting with it in the training labs and inspecting the results in BloodHound.

## 22.4.2. Analysing Data using BloodHound

In this section, we will analyze the domain data using BloodHound in Kali Linux, but it should be noted that we could install the application and required dependencies on Windows-based systems as well.

To use BloodHound, we need to start the [_Neo4j_](https://neo4j.com/) service, which is installed by default. Note that when [Bloodhound](https://www.kali.org/tools/bloodhound/) is installed with _APT_, the Neo4j service is automatically installed as well.

Neo4j is essentially an open source [graph database](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graph_database) (NoSQL) that creates nodes, edges, and properties instead of simple rows and columns. This facilitates the visual representation of our collected data. Let's go ahead and start the Neo4j service:

```
kali@kali:~$ sudo neo4j start
Directories in use:
home:         /usr/share/neo4j
config:       /usr/share/neo4j/conf
logs:         /usr/share/neo4j/logs
plugins:      /usr/share/neo4j/plugins
import:       /usr/share/neo4j/import
data:         /usr/share/neo4j/data
certificates: /usr/share/neo4j/certificates
licenses:     /usr/share/neo4j/licenses
run:          /usr/share/neo4j/run
Starting Neo4j.
Started neo4j (pid:334819). It is available at http://localhost:7474
There may be a short delay until the server is ready.
```

> Listing 80 - Starting the Neo4j service in Kali Linux

As indicated in the output, the Neo4j service is now running, and it should be available via the web interface at **http://localhost:7474**. Let's browse this location and authenticate using the default credentials (_neo4j_ as both username and password):

![Figure 2: Neo4j First Login](https://static.offsec.com/offsec-courses/PEN-200/imgs/ad_intro_enum/3355cd0fa115e245d4865adb149d2151-bhound1.png)

Figure 2: Neo4j First Login

After authenticating with the default credentials, we are prompted for a password change.

![Figure 3: Neo4j Password Change](https://static.offsec.com/offsec-courses/PEN-200/imgs/ad_intro_enum/9cf6d952aa5dbd52d63c758b38968b6e-bhound2.png)

Figure 3: Neo4j Password Change

In this case, we can choose any password we'd like; however, we must remember it since we'll also use it to authenticate to the database later.

Once we have changed the password, we can authenticate to the database and run our own queries against it. However, since we haven't imported any data yet there isn't much we can do, and we'd rather allow BloodHound to run the queries for us.

With Neo4j running, it's time to start BloodHound as well. We can do this directly from the terminal:

```
kali@kali:~$ bloodhound
```

> Listing 81 - Starting BloodHound in Kali Linux

Once we start BloodHound, we are met with an authentication window, asking us to log in to the Neo4j Database:

![Figure 4: BloodHound Login](https://static.offsec.com/offsec-courses/PEN-200/imgs/ad_intro_enum/a07811682b98af63a48f6edebd44f2d3-bhound3.png)

Figure 4: BloodHound Login

As indicated by the green check mark in the first column, BloodHound has automatically detected that we have the Neo4j database running. To log in, we use the _neo4j_ username and the password we created earlier.

Since we haven't imported data yet, we don't have any visual representation of the domain at this point. In order to import the data, we must first transfer the zip file from our Windows machine to our Kali Linux machine. We can then use the _Upload Data_ function on the right side of the GUI to upload the zip file or drag-and-drop it into BloodHound's main window. Either way, the progress bar indicates the upload progress.

![Figure 5: Uploading Collected Data](https://static.offsec.com/offsec-courses/PEN-200/imgs/ad_intro_enum/8f997331e1f3dcd1fcc2932666ce77b3-bhound4.png)

Figure 5: Uploading Collected Data

Once the upload is finished, we can close the _Upload Progress_ window.

Now it's time to start analyzing the data. Let's first get an idea about how much data the database really contains. To do this, let's click the _Hamburger_ menu at the top left. This presents the _Database Info_ as shown below:

![Figure 6: BloodHound DB Info](https://static.offsec.com/offsec-courses/PEN-200/imgs/ad_intro_enum/538fd032517a03cebeb30eb42a0d2016-bhound5.png)

Figure 6: BloodHound DB Info

Our small environment doesn't contain much. But in some cases, especially in a larger environment, the database may take some time to update. In these cases, we can use the _Refresh Database Stats_ button to present an updated view.

Looking at the information, we have discovered five total sessions in the domain, which have been enumerated (using _NetSessionEnum_ and _PsLoggedOn_ techniques we used earlier). Additionally, we have discovered a wealth of ACLs, a total of 10 users, 57 groups, and more.

We'll explain the _Node Info_ later, as there isn't much here at this point. For now, we are mostly interested in the _Analysis_ button. When we click it, we are presented with various pre-built analysis options:

![Figure 7: BloodHound Analysis Overview](https://static.offsec.com/offsec-courses/PEN-200/imgs/ad_intro_enum/2ff0e8c6b63fe3fa227241770807db9f-bhound6.png)

Figure 7: BloodHound Analysis Overview

There are many pre-built analytics queries to experiment with here, and we will not be able to cover all of them in this Module. However, to get started, let's use _Find all Domain Admins_ under _Domain Information_. This presents the graph shown below:

![Figure 8: BloodHound Domain Admins](https://static.offsec.com/offsec-courses/PEN-200/imgs/ad_intro_enum/b4e5987788889d298bee77e09aa44742-bhound7.png)

Figure 8: BloodHound Domain Admins

Each of the circle icons are known as _nodes_, and we can drag them to move them in the interface. In this case the three nodes are connected and BloodHound placed them far apart from each other, so we can simply move them closer to each other to keep everything nice and clean.

To see what the two nodes on the left represent, we can hover over them with the mouse pointer, or we can toggle the information by pressing the control button. While toggling on and off the information for each node may be preferred for some analysis, we can also tell BloodHound to show this information by default by clicking _Settings_ (represented as two cogs) on the right side of the interface and setting _Node Label Display_ to _Always Display_:

![Figure 9: BloodHound Node Display](https://static.offsec.com/offsec-courses/PEN-200/imgs/ad_intro_enum/6436a820a0881112f7f524c31c1c2c2c-bhound8.png)

Figure 9: BloodHound Node Display

Once we make that change, we can close it with the _x_ in the top right corner.

Back on the Bloodhound view, the _Domain Admins_ for the domain are indeed _jeffadmin_ and the _administrator_ account itself. As shown in Figure below, BloodHound shows an edge in the form of a line between the user objects and the _Domain Admins_ group, indicating the relationship, which in this case tells us that the users are a member of the given group:

Although BloodHound is capable of deep analysis, much of its functionality is out of scope for this Module. For now, we'll focus on the _Shortest Paths_ shown in the _Analysis_ tab.

One of the strengths of BloodHound is its ability to automatically attempt to find the shortest path possible to reach our goal, whether that goal is to take over a particular computer, user, or group.

Let's go back to the Analysis screen and scroll down to the **Shortest Path** section and select the _Find Shortest Paths to Domain Admins_. This provides a nice overview and doesn't require any parameters.

![Figure 11: BloodHound Shortest Path DA](https://static.offsec.com/offsec-courses/PEN-200/imgs/ad_intro_enum/66f78221ebcab3baa9f4dcb5600395d7-bhound10.png)

Figure 11: BloodHound Shortest Path DA

This reveals the true power of BloodHound.

Now when we run it, we can analyze this graph to determine our best attack approach. In this case, the graph will reveal a few things we didn't catch in our earlier enumeration.

For example, let's focus on the relationship between _stephanie_ and CLIENT74, which we saw in our earlier enumeration. To get more information, we can hover the mouse over the string that indicates the connection between the node to see what kind of connection it really is:

![Figure 12: BloodHound Stephanie RDP](https://static.offsec.com/offsec-courses/PEN-200/imgs/ad_intro_enum/61e1abfbe08f44b8c5893121183e004d-bhound11.png)

Figure 12: BloodHound Stephanie RDP

The small pop-up says _AdminTo_, and this indicates that _stephanie_ indeed has administrative privileges on CLIENT74. If we right-click the line between the nodes and click _? Help_, BloodHound will show additional information:

![Figure 13: BloodHound Help](https://static.offsec.com/offsec-courses/PEN-200/imgs/ad_intro_enum/4ebedc1542c7a3eb4c40b7764f631038-bhound12.png)

Figure 13: BloodHound Help

As indicated in the information above, _stephanie_ has administrative privileges on CLIENT74 and has several ways to obtain code execution on it.

In the _? Help_ menu BloodHound also offers information in the _Abuse_ tab, which will tell us more about the possible attack we can take on the given path. It also contains _Opsec_ information as what to look out for when it comes to being detected, as well as references to the information displayed.

After further reading of Figure 11, and after further inspection of the graph, we discover the connection _jeffadmin_ has to CLIENT74. This means that the credentials for _jeffadmin_ may be cached on the machine, which could be fatal for the organization. If we can take advantage of the given attack path and steal the credentials for _jeffadmin_, we should be able to log in as him and become domain administrator through his _Domain Admins_ membership.

This plays directly into the second _Shortest Path_ we'd like to show for this Module, namely the _Shortest Paths to Domain Admins from Owned Principals_. If we run this query against _corp.com_ without configuring BloodHound, we receive a "NO DATA RETURNED FROM QUERY" message.

However, the _Owned Principals_ plays a big role here and refers to the objects we are currently in control of in the domain. To analyze, we can mark any object we'd like as _owned_ in BloodHound, even if we haven't obtained access to them. Sometimes it is a good idea to think in the lines of "what if" when it comes to AD assessments. In this case however, we will leave the imagination on the side and focus on the objects we in fact have control over.

The only object we know for a fact we have control over is the _stephanie_ user, and we have partial control over CLIENT75, since that is where we are logged in. We do not have administrative privileges, so we may need to think about doing privilege escalation on the machine later, but for now, let's say that we have control over it.

In order for us to obtain an _owned principal_ in BloodHound, we will run a search (top left), right click the object that shows in the middle of the screen and click _Mark User as Owned_. Since we are already at the user _stephanie_ we can simply right-click and select _Mark User as Owned_ A principal marked as _owned_ is shown in BloodHound with a skull icon next to the node itself.

![Figure 14: BloodHound Mark Owned](https://static.offsec.com/offsec-courses/PEN-200/imgs/ad_intro_enum/363e76fb6ca0f6c31155015ddfb2a6a6-bhound13.png)

Figure 14: BloodHound Mark Owned

One thing to note here is that if we click the icon for the object we are searching, it will be placed into the _Node Info_ button where we can read more about the object itself.

We'll repeat the process for CLIENT75 as well, however in this case we click _Mark Computer as Owned_, and we end up having two _owned principals_.

Info

It's a good idea to mark every object we have access to as _owned_ to improve our visibility into more potential attack vectors. There may be a short path to our goals that hinges on ownership of a particular object.

Now that we informed BloodHound about our owned principals, we can run the _Shortest Paths to Domain Admins from Owned Principals_ query:

![Figure 15: BloodHound Shortest Path DA from Owned Principals](https://static.offsec.com/offsec-courses/PEN-200/imgs/ad_intro_enum/8dc7c1f9ec1ea297fb3443368382d3ab-bhound14.png)

Figure 15: BloodHound Shortest Path DA from Owned Principals

Let's read this by starting with the left-hand node, which is CLIENT75. As expected, _stephanie_ has a session there. The _stephanie_ user should be able to connect to CLIENT74, where _jeffadmin_ has a session. _jeffadmin_ is a part of the _Domain Admins_ group, so if we can take control of his account by either impersonating him or stealing the credentials on CLIENT74, we will be domain administrators.

BloodHound comes with a wealth of functions and options we cannot fully cover in this Module. While we focused mostly on shortest paths, we highly recommend getting accustomed to the other BloodHound pre-built queries within the Challenge Labs.

In this domain, we were able to enumerate most of the information using manual methods first, but in a large-scale production environment with thousands of users and computers, the information may be difficult to digest. Although the queries from SharpHound generate noise in the network and will likely be caught by security analysts, it is a tool worth running if the situation allows it, since it gives a nice visual overview of the environment at run time.

## Resources

Some of the labs require you to start the target machine(s) below.

3. **Capstone Exercise**: Start VM Group 2 and log in as _stephanie_ to CLIENT75. From CLIENT75, enumerate the object permissions for the domain users. Once weak permissions have been identified, use them to take full control over the account and use it to log in to the domain. Once logged in, repeat the enumeration process using techniques shown in this Module to obtain the flag.

## 22.5. Wrapping Up

In this Module, we explored several ways to enumerate Active Directory, each of which leveraged LDAP as well as PowerShell .NET classes. Given that Active Directory contains a wealth of information, enumerating it is a critical step during a penetration test.

The enumeration methods from this Module provide us with the basic skills required to perform enumeration in a domain environment. While we cannot possibly cover all possible enumeration techniques, it is critical to dive deeper in the labs and explore the .NET classes, PowerView functions, and BloodHound queries.

In the upcoming _Attacking Active Directory Authentication_ and _Lateral Movement in Active Directory_ Modules, we will use the information obtained from this Module and leverage it to attack various Active Directory authentication methods as well as move laterally between targets.
