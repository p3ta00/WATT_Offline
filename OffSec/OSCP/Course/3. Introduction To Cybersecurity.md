## 3.1. The Practice of Cybersecurity

This Learning Unit covers the following Learning Objectives:

-   Recognize the challenges unique to information security
-   Understand how "offensive" and "defensive" security reflect each other
-   Begin to build a mental model of useful mindsets applicable to information security

## 3.1.1. Challenges in Cybersecurity

Cybersecurity has emerged as a unique discipline and is not a sub-field or niche area of software engineering or system administration. There are a few distinct characteristics of cybersecurity that distinguish it from other technical fields. First, security involves _malicious_ and _intelligent_ actors (i.e. opponents).

The problem of dealing with an intelligent opponent requires a different approach, discipline, and mindset compared to facing a naturally occurring or accidental problem. Whether we are simulating an attack or defending against one, we will need to consider the perspective and potential actions of our opponent and try to anticipate what they might do. Because our opponents are human beings with _agency_, they can reason, predict, judge, analyze, conjecture, and deliberate. They can also feel emotions like happiness, sorrow, greed, fear, triumph, and guilt. Both attackers and defenders can leverage the emotions of their human opponents. For example, an attacker might rely on embarrassment by holding a computer system hostage and threaten to publish its data. Defenders, meanwhile, might leverage fear to dissuade attackers from entering their networks. This reality means human beings are a _critical_ component of cybersecurity.

Another important aspect of security is that it usually involves _reasoning under uncertainty_. Although we have plenty of deductive skills, we are by no means mentally omniscient. We cannot determine _everything_ that follows from a given truth, and we cannot know or remember an infinite number of facts.

Consider how a game like chess is different from a game like poker. In chess, you know everything that your opponent does about the game state (and vice versa). You may not know what they are thinking, but you can make predictions about their next move based on the same information that they are using to determine it. Playing poker, however, you do not have all the information that your opponent possesses, so you must make predictions based on incomplete data.

When considering the mental perspectives of attackers and defenders, information security is a lot closer to poker than chess. For example, when we simulate an attack, we will never know everything there is to know about the machine/system/network/organization we are targeting. We therefore must make assumptions and estimate probabilities, sometimes implicitly and sometimes explicitly.

Conversely, as defenders, we will not be aware of every potential attack vector or vulnerability we might be exposed to. We therefore need to hedge our bets and make sure that our attack surfaces that are most likely to be vulnerable are adequately protected.

The problem of the intelligent adversary and the problem of uncertainty both suggest that understanding cybersecurity necessitates learning more about how we _think_ as human agents, and how to solve problems. This means we'll need to adopt and nurture specific _mindsets_ that will help us as we learn and apply our skills.

## 3.1.2. A Word on Mindsets

Security is not only about understanding technology and code but also about understanding your own mind and that of your adversary. We tend to think of a mindset as _a set of beliefs that inform our personal perspective_ on something.

Two contrasting examples of well-known mindsets are the _fixed_ mindset and the _growth_ mindset.

An individual with a fixed mindset believes that their skill/talent/capacity to learn is what it is and that there is no gain to be made by trying to improve.

On the other hand, a growth mindset encourages the belief that mental ability is flexible and adaptable, and that one can grow their capacity to learn over time.

Research suggests that, for example, a mindset in which we believe ourselves capable of [recovering from a mistake](https://www.psychologicalscience.org/news/releases/how-the-brain-reacts-to-mistakes.html) makes us measurably better at doing so. This is just one aspect of the growth mindset, but it's an important one. This is because security requires us to make mistakes and learn from them and to be constantly learning and re-evaluating.

Another extremely valuable mindset is the aptly coined _security mindset_. Proposed by security researcher [Bruce Schneier](https://www.schneier.com/blog/archives/2008/03/the_security_mi_1.html). This mindset encourages a constant questioning of how one can attack (or defend) a system. If we can begin to ask this question automatically when encountering a novel idea, machine, system, network, or object, we can start noticing a wide array of recurring patterns.

At OffSec, we encourage learners to adopt the [_"Try Harder"_](https://www.offsec.com/offsec/what-it-means-to-try-harder/) mindset. To better understand this mindset, let's quickly consider two potential perspectives in a moment of "failure."

1.  If my attack or defense fails, it represents a truth about my current skills/processes/configurations/approach as much as it is a truth about the system.
    
2.  If my attack or defense fails, this allows me to learn something new, change my approach, and do something differently.
    

These two perspectives help provide someone with the mental fortitude to make mistakes and learn from them, which is essential in any cybersecurity sub-field. More information about how to learn and the Try Harder mindset can be found in the "Effective Learning Strategies" Module that is part of this introductory Learning Path.

## 3.1.3. On Emulating the Minds of our Opponents

It's worth pausing to consider the particular attention that we will give to the [_offensive_](https://mjkranch.com/2019/02/why_we_should_teach_offense_first/) side of security, even in many of our defensive courses and Modules. One might wonder why a cybersecurity professional whose primary interest and goal is defending a network, organization, or government should also learn the offensive side.

Let's take the analogy of a medieval monarch building a castle. If the monarch learns that their enemy has catapults capable of hurling large boulders, they might design their castle to have thicker walls. Similarly, if their enemy is equipped with ladders, the monarch might give their troops tools to push the ladders off the walls.

The more this monarch knows about their would-be attacker and the more they can _think like an attacker_, the better defense they can build. The monarch might engage in "offensive" types of activities or _audits_ to understand the gaps in their own defenses. For example, they could conduct "war games" where they direct their own soldiers to mock-battle each other, helping them fully understand the capabilities and destructive potential of a real attacker.

In cybersecurity, enterprises might hire an individual or a firm to perform a penetration test, also known as a _pentest_. A penetration tester takes on the role of an attacker to better understand the system's vulnerabilities and exposed weaknesses.

Leveraging the skill sets and mindsets of an attacker allows us to better answer questions like:

-   "How might an attacker gain access?"
-   "What can they do with that access?"
-   "What are the worst possible outcomes from an attack?"

While learning hacking skills is (of course) essential for aspiring penetration testers, we also believe that defenders, system administrators, and developers will greatly benefit from at least a cursory education in offensive techniques and technologies as well.

Conversely, it's been our experience that many of the best penetration testers and web application hackers are those who have had extensive exposure to defending networks, building web applications, or administrating systems.

-   "How might an attacker gain access?"
-   "What can they do with that access?"
-   "What are the worst possible outcomes from an attack?"

While learning hacking skills is (of course) essential for aspiring penetration testers, we also believe that defenders, system administrators, and developers will greatly benefit from at least a cursory education in offensive techniques and technologies as well.

Conversely, it's been our experience that many of the best penetration testers and web application hackers are those who have had extensive exposure to defending networks, building web applications, or administrating systems.

# 3\. Introduction To Cybersecurity

We will cover the following Learning Units in this Learning Module:

-   The Practice of Cybersecurity
-   Threats and Threat Actors
-   The CIA Triad
-   Security Principles, Controls, and Strategies
-   Cybersecurity Laws, Regulations, Standards, and Frameworks
-   Career Opportunities in Cybersecurity

This Module is designed to provide learners, regardless of current proficiency or experience, with a solid understanding of the fundamental principles of cybersecurity. It is intended for a wide range of individuals, from employees working adjacent to information technology or managing technical teams to learners just getting started in the highly dynamic information security field.

Completing this Module will help learners build a useful base of knowledge for progressing onto more technical, hands-on Modules.

An in-depth analysis of each concept is outside the scope of this Module. To learn more about the concepts introduced here, learners are encouraged to progress through the 100-level content in the OffSec Learning Library.

Throughout this Module, we'll examine some recent examples of cyber-attacks and analyze their impact as well as potential prevention or mitigation steps. We'll also supply various links to articles, references, and resources for future exploration. Please review these links for additional context and clarity.

## 3.1. The Practice of Cybersecurity

This Learning Unit covers the following Learning Objectives:

-   Recognize the challenges unique to information security
-   Understand how "offensive" and "defensive" security reflect each other
-   Begin to build a mental model of useful mindsets applicable to information security

## 3.1.1. Challenges in Cybersecurity

Cybersecurity has emerged as a unique discipline and is not a sub-field or niche area of software engineering or system administration. There are a few distinct characteristics of cybersecurity that distinguish it from other technical fields. First, security involves _malicious_ and _intelligent_ actors (i.e. opponents).

The problem of dealing with an intelligent opponent requires a different approach, discipline, and mindset compared to facing a naturally occurring or accidental problem. Whether we are simulating an attack or defending against one, we will need to consider the perspective and potential actions of our opponent and try to anticipate what they might do. Because our opponents are human beings with _agency_, they can reason, predict, judge, analyze, conjecture, and deliberate. They can also feel emotions like happiness, sorrow, greed, fear, triumph, and guilt. Both attackers and defenders can leverage the emotions of their human opponents. For example, an attacker might rely on embarrassment by holding a computer system hostage and threaten to publish its data. Defenders, meanwhile, might leverage fear to dissuade attackers from entering their networks. This reality means human beings are a _critical_ component of cybersecurity.

Another important aspect of security is that it usually involves _reasoning under uncertainty_. Although we have plenty of deductive skills, we are by no means mentally omniscient. We cannot determine _everything_ that follows from a given truth, and we cannot know or remember an infinite number of facts.

Consider how a game like chess is different from a game like poker. In chess, you know everything that your opponent does about the game state (and vice versa). You may not know what they are thinking, but you can make predictions about their next move based on the same information that they are using to determine it. Playing poker, however, you do not have all the information that your opponent possesses, so you must make predictions based on incomplete data.

When considering the mental perspectives of attackers and defenders, information security is a lot closer to poker than chess. For example, when we simulate an attack, we will never know everything there is to know about the machine/system/network/organization we are targeting. We therefore must make assumptions and estimate probabilities, sometimes implicitly and sometimes explicitly.

Conversely, as defenders, we will not be aware of every potential attack vector or vulnerability we might be exposed to. We therefore need to hedge our bets and make sure that our attack surfaces that are most likely to be vulnerable are adequately protected.

The problem of the intelligent adversary and the problem of uncertainty both suggest that understanding cybersecurity necessitates learning more about how we _think_ as human agents, and how to solve problems. This means we'll need to adopt and nurture specific _mindsets_ that will help us as we learn and apply our skills.

## 3.1.2. A Word on Mindsets

Security is not only about understanding technology and code but also about understanding your own mind and that of your adversary. We tend to think of a mindset as _a set of beliefs that inform our personal perspective_ on something.

Two contrasting examples of well-known mindsets are the _fixed_ mindset and the _growth_ mindset.

An individual with a fixed mindset believes that their skill/talent/capacity to learn is what it is and that there is no gain to be made by trying to improve.

On the other hand, a growth mindset encourages the belief that mental ability is flexible and adaptable, and that one can grow their capacity to learn over time.

Research suggests that, for example, a mindset in which we believe ourselves capable of [recovering from a mistake](https://www.psychologicalscience.org/news/releases/how-the-brain-reacts-to-mistakes.html) makes us measurably better at doing so. This is just one aspect of the growth mindset, but it's an important one. This is because security requires us to make mistakes and learn from them and to be constantly learning and re-evaluating.

Another extremely valuable mindset is the aptly coined _security mindset_. Proposed by security researcher [Bruce Schneier](https://www.schneier.com/blog/archives/2008/03/the_security_mi_1.html). This mindset encourages a constant questioning of how one can attack (or defend) a system. If we can begin to ask this question automatically when encountering a novel idea, machine, system, network, or object, we can start noticing a wide array of recurring patterns.

At OffSec, we encourage learners to adopt the [_"Try Harder"_](https://www.offsec.com/offsec/what-it-means-to-try-harder/) mindset. To better understand this mindset, let's quickly consider two potential perspectives in a moment of "failure."

1.  If my attack or defense fails, it represents a truth about my current skills/processes/configurations/approach as much as it is a truth about the system.
    
2.  If my attack or defense fails, this allows me to learn something new, change my approach, and do something differently.
    

These two perspectives help provide someone with the mental fortitude to make mistakes and learn from them, which is essential in any cybersecurity sub-field. More information about how to learn and the Try Harder mindset can be found in the "Effective Learning Strategies" Module that is part of this introductory Learning Path.

## 3.1.3. On Emulating the Minds of our Opponents

It's worth pausing to consider the particular attention that we will give to the [_offensive_](https://mjkranch.com/2019/02/why_we_should_teach_offense_first/) side of security, even in many of our defensive courses and Modules. One might wonder why a cybersecurity professional whose primary interest and goal is defending a network, organization, or government should also learn the offensive side.

Let's take the analogy of a medieval monarch building a castle. If the monarch learns that their enemy has catapults capable of hurling large boulders, they might design their castle to have thicker walls. Similarly, if their enemy is equipped with ladders, the monarch might give their troops tools to push the ladders off the walls.

The more this monarch knows about their would-be attacker and the more they can _think like an attacker_, the better defense they can build. The monarch might engage in "offensive" types of activities or _audits_ to understand the gaps in their own defenses. For example, they could conduct "war games" where they direct their own soldiers to mock-battle each other, helping them fully understand the capabilities and destructive potential of a real attacker.

In cybersecurity, enterprises might hire an individual or a firm to perform a penetration test, also known as a _pentest_. A penetration tester takes on the role of an attacker to better understand the system's vulnerabilities and exposed weaknesses.

Leveraging the skill sets and mindsets of an attacker allows us to better answer questions like:

One might wonder why a cybersecurity professional whose primary interest and goal is defending a network, organization, or government should also learn the offensive side.

Let's take the analogy of a medieval monarch building a castle. If the monarch learns that their enemy has catapults capable of hurling large boulders, they might design their castle to have thicker walls. Similarly, if their enemy is equipped with ladders, the monarch might give their troops tools to push the ladders off the walls.

The more this monarch knows about their would-be attacker and the more they can _think like an attacker_, the better defense they can build. The monarch might engage in "offensive" types of activities or _audits_ to understand the gaps in their own defenses. For example, they could conduct "war games" where they direct their own soldiers to mock-battle each other, helping them fully understand the capabilities and destructive potential of a real attacker.

In cybersecurity, enterprises might hire an individual or a firm to perform a penetration test, also known as a _pentest_. A penetration tester takes on the role of an attacker to better understand the system's vulnerabilities and exposed weaknesses.

Leveraging the skill sets and mindsets of an attacker allows us to better answer questions like:

-   "How might an attacker gain access?"
-   "What can they do with that access?"
-   "What are the worst possible outcomes from an attack?"

While learning hacking skills is (of course) essential for aspiring penetration testers, we also believe that defenders, system administrators, and developers will greatly benefit from at least a cursory education in offensive techniques and technologies as well.

Conversely, it's been our experience that many of the best penetration testers and web application hackers are those who have had extensive exposure to defending networks, building web applications, or administrating systems.

# 3\. Introduction To Cybersecurity

We will cover the following Learning Units in this Learning Module:

-   The Practice of Cybersecurity
-   Threats and Threat Actors
-   The CIA Triad
-   Security Principles, Controls, and Strategies
-   Cybersecurity Laws, Regulations, Standards, and Frameworks
-   Career Opportunities in Cybersecurity

This Module is designed to provide learners, regardless of current proficiency or experience, with a solid understanding of the fundamental principles of cybersecurity. It is intended for a wide range of individuals, from employees working adjacent to information technology or managing technical teams to learners just getting started in the highly dynamic information security field.

Completing this Module will help learners build a useful base of knowledge for progressing onto more technical, hands-on Modules.

An in-depth analysis of each concept is outside the scope of this Module. To learn more about the concepts introduced here, learners are encouraged to progress through the 100-level content in the OffSec Learning Library.

Throughout this Module, we'll examine some recent examples of cyber-attacks and analyze their impact as well as potential prevention or mitigation steps. We'll also supply various links to articles, references, and resources for future exploration. Please review these links for additional context and clarity.

## 3.1. The Practice of Cybersecurity

This Learning Unit covers the following Learning Objectives:

-   Recognize the challenges unique to information security
-   Understand how "offensive" and "defensive" security reflect each other
-   Begin to build a mental model of useful mindsets applicable to information security

## 3.1.1. Challenges in Cybersecurity

Cybersecurity has emerged as a unique discipline and is not a sub-field or niche area of software engineering or system administration. There are a few distinct characteristics of cybersecurity that distinguish it from other technical fields. First, security involves _malicious_ and _intelligent_ actors (i.e. opponents).

The problem of dealing with an intelligent opponent requires a different approach, discipline, and mindset compared to facing a naturally occurring or accidental problem. Whether we are simulating an attack or defending against one, we will need to consider the perspective and potential actions of our opponent and try to anticipate what they might do. Because our opponents are human beings with _agency_, they can reason, predict, judge, analyze, conjecture, and deliberate. They can also feel emotions like happiness, sorrow, greed, fear, triumph, and guilt. Both attackers and defenders can leverage the emotions of their human opponents. For example, an attacker might rely on embarrassment by holding a computer system hostage and threaten to publish its data. Defenders, meanwhile, might leverage fear to dissuade attackers from entering their networks. This reality means human beings are a _critical_ component of cybersecurity.

Another important aspect of security is that it usually involves _reasoning under uncertainty_. Although we have plenty of deductive skills, we are by no means mentally omniscient. We cannot determine _everything_ that follows from a given truth, and we cannot know or remember an infinite number of facts.

Consider how a game like chess is different from a game like poker. In chess, you know everything that your opponent does about the game state (and vice versa). You may not know what they are thinking, but you can make predictions about their next move based on the same information that they are using to determine it. Playing poker, however, you do not have all the information that your opponent possesses, so you must make predictions based on incomplete data.

When considering the mental perspectives of attackers and defenders, information security is a lot closer to poker than chess. For example, when we simulate an attack, we will never know everything there is to know about the machine/system/network/organization we are targeting. We therefore must make assumptions and estimate probabilities, sometimes implicitly and sometimes explicitly.

Conversely, as defenders, we will not be aware of every potential attack vector or vulnerability we might be exposed to. We therefore need to hedge our bets and make sure that our attack surfaces that are most likely to be vulnerable are adequately protected.

The problem of the intelligent adversary and the problem of uncertainty both suggest that understanding cybersecurity necessitates learning more about how we _think_ as human agents, and how to solve problems. This means we'll need to adopt and nurture specific _mindsets_ that will help us as we learn and apply our skills.

## 3.1.2. A Word on Mindsets

Security is not only about understanding technology and code but also about understanding your own mind and that of your adversary. We tend to think of a mindset as _a set of beliefs that inform our personal perspective_ on something.

Two contrasting examples of well-known mindsets are the _fixed_ mindset and the _growth_ mindset.

An individual with a fixed mindset believes that their skill/talent/capacity to learn is what it is and that there is no gain to be made by trying to improve.

On the other hand, a growth mindset encourages the belief that mental ability is flexible and adaptable, and that one can grow their capacity to learn over time.

Research suggests that, for example, a mindset in which we believe ourselves capable of [recovering from a mistake](https://www.psychologicalscience.org/news/releases/how-the-brain-reacts-to-mistakes.html) makes us measurably better at doing so. This is just one aspect of the growth mindset, but it's an important one. This is because security requires us to make mistakes and learn from them and to be constantly learning and re-evaluating.

Another extremely valuable mindset is the aptly coined _security mindset_. Proposed by security researcher [Bruce Schneier](https://www.schneier.com/blog/archives/2008/03/the_security_mi_1.html). This mindset encourages a constant questioning of how one can attack (or defend) a system. If we can begin to ask this question automatically when encountering a novel idea, machine, system, network, or object, we can start noticing a wide array of recurring patterns.

At OffSec, we encourage learners to adopt the [_"Try Harder"_](https://www.offsec.com/offsec/what-it-means-to-try-harder/) mindset. To better understand this mindset, let's quickly consider two potential perspectives in a moment of "failure."

1.  If my attack or defense fails, it represents a truth about my current skills/processes/configurations/approach as much as it is a truth about the system.
    
2.  If my attack or defense fails, this allows me to learn something new, change my approach, and do something differently.
    

These two perspectives help provide someone with the mental fortitude to make mistakes and learn from them, which is essential in any cybersecurity sub-field. More information about how to learn and the Try Harder mindset can be found in the "Effective Learning Strategies" Module that is part of this introductory Learning Path.

At OffSec, we encourage learners to adopt the [_"Try Harder"_](https://www.offsec.com/offsec/what-it-means-to-try-harder/) mindset. To better understand this mindset, let's quickly consider two potential perspectives in a moment of "failure."

1.  If my attack or defense fails, it represents a truth about my current skills/processes/configurations/approach as much as it is a truth about the system.
    
2.  If my attack or defense fails, this allows me to learn something new, change my approach, and do something differently.
    

These two perspectives help provide someone with the mental fortitude to make mistakes and learn from them, which is essential in any cybersecurity sub-field. More information about how to learn and the Try Harder mindset can be found in the "Effective Learning Strategies" Module that is part of this introductory Learning Path.

## 3.1.3. On Emulating the Minds of our Opponents

It's worth pausing to consider the particular attention that we will give to the [_offensive_](https://mjkranch.com/2019/02/why_we_should_teach_offense_first/) side of security, even in many of our defensive courses and Modules. One might wonder why a cybersecurity professional whose primary interest and goal is defending a network, organization, or government should also learn the offensive side.

Let's take the analogy of a medieval monarch building a castle. If the monarch learns that their enemy has catapults capable of hurling large boulders, they might design their castle to have thicker walls. Similarly, if their enemy is equipped with ladders, the monarch might give their troops tools to push the ladders off the walls.

The more this monarch knows about their would-be attacker and the more they can _think like an attacker_, the better defense they can build. The monarch might engage in "offensive" types of activities or _audits_ to understand the gaps in their own defenses. For example, they could conduct "war games" where they direct their own soldiers to mock-battle each other, helping them fully understand the capabilities and destructive potential of a real attacker.

In cybersecurity, enterprises might hire an individual or a firm to perform a penetration test, also known as a _pentest_. A penetration tester takes on the role of an attacker to better understand the system's vulnerabilities and exposed weaknesses.

Leveraging the skill sets and mindsets of an attacker allows us to better answer questions like:

-   "How might an attacker gain access?"
-   "What can they do with that access?"
-   "What are the worst possible outcomes from an attack?"

While learning hacking skills is (of course) essential for aspiring penetration testers, we also believe that defenders, system administrators, and developers will greatly benefit from at least a cursory education in offensive techniques and technologies as well.

Conversely, it's been our experience that many of the best penetration testers and web application hackers are those who have had extensive exposure to defending networks, building web applications, or administrating systems.

# 3\. Introduction To Cybersecurity

We will cover the following Learning Units in this Learning Module:

-   The Practice of Cybersecurity
-   Threats and Threat Actors
-   The CIA Triad
-   Security Principles, Controls, and Strategies
-   Cybersecurity Laws, Regulations, Standards, and Frameworks
-   Career Opportunities in Cybersecurity

This Module is designed to provide learners, regardless of current proficiency or experience, with a solid understanding of the fundamental principles of cybersecurity. It is intended for a wide range of individuals, from employees working adjacent to information technology or managing technical teams to learners just getting started in the highly dynamic information security field.

Completing this Module will help learners build a useful base of knowledge for progressing onto more technical, hands-on Modules.

An in-depth analysis of each concept is outside the scope of this Module. To learn more about the concepts introduced here, learners are encouraged to progress through the 100-level content in the OffSec Learning Library.

Throughout this Module, we'll examine some recent examples of cyber-attacks and analyze their impact as well as potential prevention or mitigation steps. We'll also supply various links to articles, references, and resources for future exploration. Please review these links for additional context and clarity.

## 3.1. The Practice of Cybersecurity

This Learning Unit covers the following Learning Objectives:

-   Recognize the challenges unique to information security
-   Understand how "offensive" and "defensive" security reflect each other
-   Begin to build a mental model of useful mindsets applicable to information security

## 3.1.1. Challenges in Cybersecurity

Cybersecurity has emerged as a unique discipline and is not a sub-field or niche area of software engineering or system administration. There are a few distinct characteristics of cybersecurity that distinguish it from other technical fields. First, security involves _malicious_ and _intelligent_ actors (i.e. opponents).

The problem of dealing with an intelligent opponent requires a different approach, discipline, and mindset compared to facing a naturally occurring or accidental problem. Whether we are simulating an attack or defending against one, we will need to consider the perspective and potential actions of our opponent and try to anticipate what they might do. Because our opponents are human beings with _agency_, they can reason, predict, judge, analyze, conjecture, and deliberate. They can also feel emotions like happiness, sorrow, greed, fear, triumph, and guilt. Both attackers and defenders can leverage the emotions of their human opponents. For example, an attacker might rely on embarrassment by holding a computer system hostage and threaten to publish its data. Defenders, meanwhile, might leverage fear to dissuade attackers from entering their networks. This reality means human beings are a _critical_ component of cybersecurity.

Another important aspect of security is that it usually involves _reasoning under uncertainty_. Although we have plenty of deductive skills, we are by no means mentally omniscient. We cannot determine _everything_ that follows from a given truth, and we cannot know or remember an infinite number of facts.

Consider how a game like chess is different from a game like poker. In chess, you know everything that your opponent does about the game state (and vice versa). You may not know what they are thinking, but you can make predictions about their next move based on the same information that they are using to determine it. Playing poker, however, you do not have all the information that your opponent possesses, so you must make predictions based on incomplete data.

When considering the mental perspectives of attackers and defenders, information security is a lot closer to poker than chess. For example, when we simulate an attack, we will never know everything there is to know about the machine/system/network/organization we are targeting. We therefore must make assumptions and estimate probabilities, sometimes implicitly and sometimes explicitly.

Conversely, as defenders, we will not be aware of every potential attack vector or vulnerability we might be exposed to. We therefore need to hedge our bets and make sure that our attack surfaces that are most likely to be vulnerable are adequately protected.

The problem of the intelligent adversary and the problem of uncertainty both suggest that understanding cybersecurity necessitates learning more about how we _think_ as human agents, and how to solve problems. This means we'll need to adopt and nurture specific _mindsets_ that will help us as we learn and apply our skills.

## 3.1.2. A Word on Mindsets

Security is not only about understanding technology and code but also about understanding your own mind and that of your adversary. We tend to think of a mindset as _a set of beliefs that inform our personal perspective_ on something.

Two contrasting examples of well-known mindsets are the _fixed_ mindset and the _growth_ mindset.

An individual with a fixed mindset believes that their skill/talent/capacity to learn is what it is and that there is no gain to be made by trying to improve.

On the other hand, a growth mindset encourages the belief that mental ability is flexible and adaptable, and that one can grow their capacity to learn over time.

Research suggests that, for example, a mindset in which we believe ourselves capable of [recovering from a mistake](https://www.psychologicalscience.org/news/releases/how-the-brain-reacts-to-mistakes.html) makes us measurably better at doing so. This is just one aspect of the growth mindset, but it's an important one. This is because security requires us to make mistakes and learn from them and to be constantly learning and re-evaluating.

Another extremely valuable mindset is the aptly coined _security mindset_. Proposed by security researcher [Bruce Schneier](https://www.schneier.com/blog/archives/2008/03/the_security_mi_1.html). This mindset encourages a constant questioning of how one can attack (or defend) a system. If we can begin to ask this question automatically when encountering a novel idea, machine, system, network, or object, we can start noticing a wide array of recurring patterns.

On the other hand, a growth mindset encourages the belief that mental ability is flexible and adaptable, and that one can grow their capacity to learn over time.

Research suggests that, for example, a mindset in which we believe ourselves capable of [recovering from a mistake](https://www.psychologicalscience.org/news/releases/how-the-brain-reacts-to-mistakes.html) makes us measurably better at doing so. This is just one aspect of the growth mindset, but it's an important one. This is because security requires us to make mistakes and learn from them and to be constantly learning and re-evaluating.

Another extremely valuable mindset is the aptly coined _security mindset_. Proposed by security researcher [Bruce Schneier](https://www.schneier.com/blog/archives/2008/03/the_security_mi_1.html). This mindset encourages a constant questioning of how one can attack (or defend) a system. If we can begin to ask this question automatically when encountering a novel idea, machine, system, network, or object, we can start noticing a wide array of recurring patterns.

At OffSec, we encourage learners to adopt the [_"Try Harder"_](https://www.offsec.com/offsec/what-it-means-to-try-harder/) mindset. To better understand this mindset, let's quickly consider two potential perspectives in a moment of "failure."

1.  If my attack or defense fails, it represents a truth about my current skills/processes/configurations/approach as much as it is a truth about the system.
    
2.  If my attack or defense fails, this allows me to learn something new, change my approach, and do something differently.
    

These two perspectives help provide someone with the mental fortitude to make mistakes and learn from them, which is essential in any cybersecurity sub-field. More information about how to learn and the Try Harder mindset can be found in the "Effective Learning Strategies" Module that is part of this introductory Learning Path.

## 3.1.3. On Emulating the Minds of our Opponents

It's worth pausing to consider the particular attention that we will give to the [_offensive_](https://mjkranch.com/2019/02/why_we_should_teach_offense_first/) side of security, even in many of our defensive courses and Modules. One might wonder why a cybersecurity professional whose primary interest and goal is defending a network, organization, or government should also learn the offensive side.

Let's take the analogy of a medieval monarch building a castle. If the monarch learns that their enemy has catapults capable of hurling large boulders, they might design their castle to have thicker walls. Similarly, if their enemy is equipped with ladders, the monarch might give their troops tools to push the ladders off the walls.

The more this monarch knows about their would-be attacker and the more they can _think like an attacker_, the better defense they can build. The monarch might engage in "offensive" types of activities or _audits_ to understand the gaps in their own defenses. For example, they could conduct "war games" where they direct their own soldiers to mock-battle each other, helping them fully understand the capabilities and destructive potential of a real attacker.

In cybersecurity, enterprises might hire an individual or a firm to perform a penetration test, also known as a _pentest_. A penetration tester takes on the role of an attacker to better understand the system's vulnerabilities and exposed weaknesses.

Leveraging the skill sets and mindsets of an attacker allows us to better answer questions like:

-   "How might an attacker gain access?"
-   "What can they do with that access?"
-   "What are the worst possible outcomes from an attack?"

While learning hacking skills is (of course) essential for aspiring penetration testers, we also believe that defenders, system administrators, and developers will greatly benefit from at least a cursory education in offensive techniques and technologies as well.

Conversely, it's been our experience that many of the best penetration testers and web application hackers are those who have had extensive exposure to defending networks, building web applications, or administrating systems.

# 3\. Introduction To Cybersecurity

We will cover the following Learning Units in this Learning Module:

-   The Practice of Cybersecurity
-   Threats and Threat Actors
-   The CIA Triad
-   Security Principles, Controls, and Strategies
-   Cybersecurity Laws, Regulations, Standards, and Frameworks
-   Career Opportunities in Cybersecurity

This Module is designed to provide learners, regardless of current proficiency or experience, with a solid understanding of the fundamental principles of cybersecurity. It is intended for a wide range of individuals, from employees working adjacent to information technology or managing technical teams to learners just getting started in the highly dynamic information security field.

Completing this Module will help learners build a useful base of knowledge for progressing onto more technical, hands-on Modules.

An in-depth analysis of each concept is outside the scope of this Module. To learn more about the concepts introduced here, learners are encouraged to progress through the 100-level content in the OffSec Learning Library.

Throughout this Module, we'll examine some recent examples of cyber-attacks and analyze their impact as well as potential prevention or mitigation steps. We'll also supply various links to articles, references, and resources for future exploration. Please review these links for additional context and clarity.

## 3.1. The Practice of Cybersecurity

This Learning Unit covers the following Learning Objectives:

-   Recognize the challenges unique to information security
-   Understand how "offensive" and "defensive" security reflect each other
-   Begin to build a mental model of useful mindsets applicable to information security

## 3.1.1. Challenges in Cybersecurity

Cybersecurity has emerged as a unique discipline and is not a sub-field or niche area of software engineering or system administration. There are a few distinct characteristics of cybersecurity that distinguish it from other technical fields. First, security involves _malicious_ and _intelligent_ actors (i.e. opponents).

The problem of dealing with an intelligent opponent requires a different approach, discipline, and mindset compared to facing a naturally occurring or accidental problem. Whether we are simulating an attack or defending against one, we will need to consider the perspective and potential actions of our opponent and try to anticipate what they might do. Because our opponents are human beings with _agency_, they can reason, predict, judge, analyze, conjecture, and deliberate. They can also feel emotions like happiness, sorrow, greed, fear, triumph, and guilt. Both attackers and defenders can leverage the emotions of their human opponents. For example, an attacker might rely on embarrassment by holding a computer system hostage and threaten to publish its data. Defenders, meanwhile, might leverage fear to dissuade attackers from entering their networks. This reality means human beings are a _critical_ component of cybersecurity.

Another important aspect of security is that it usually involves _reasoning under uncertainty_. Although we have plenty of deductive skills, we are by no means mentally omniscient. We cannot determine _everything_ that follows from a given truth, and we cannot know or remember an infinite number of facts.

Consider how a game like chess is different from a game like poker. In chess, you know everything that your opponent does about the game state (and vice versa). You may not know what they are thinking, but you can make predictions about their next move based on the same information that they are using to determine it. Playing poker, however, you do not have all the information that your opponent possesses, so you must make predictions based on incomplete data.

When considering the mental perspectives of attackers and defenders, information security is a lot closer to poker than chess. For example, when we simulate an attack, we will never know everything there is to know about the machine/system/network/organization we are targeting. We therefore must make assumptions and estimate probabilities, sometimes implicitly and sometimes explicitly.

Conversely, as defenders, we will not be aware of every potential attack vector or vulnerability we might be exposed to. We therefore need to hedge our bets and make sure that our attack surfaces that are most likely to be vulnerable are adequately protected.

The problem of the intelligent adversary and the problem of uncertainty both suggest that understanding cybersecurity necessitates learning more about how we _think_ as human agents, and how to solve problems. This means we'll need to adopt and nurture specific _mindsets_ that will help us as we learn and apply our skills.

## 3.1.2. A Word on Mindsets

Security is not only about understanding technology and code but also about understanding your own mind and that of your adversary. We tend to think of a mindset as _a set of beliefs that inform our personal perspective_ on something.

Two contrasting examples of well-known mindsets are the _fixed_ mindset and the _growth_ mindset.

An individual with a fixed mindset believes that their skill/talent/capacity to learn is what it is and that there is no gain to be made by trying to improve.

On the other hand, a growth mindset encourages the belief that mental ability is flexible and adaptable, and that one can grow their capacity to learn over time.

We therefore must make assumptions and estimate probabilities, sometimes implicitly and sometimes explicitly.

Conversely, as defenders, we will not be aware of every potential attack vector or vulnerability we might be exposed to. We therefore need to hedge our bets and make sure that our attack surfaces that are most likely to be vulnerable are adequately protected.

The problem of the intelligent adversary and the problem of uncertainty both suggest that understanding cybersecurity necessitates learning more about how we _think_ as human agents, and how to solve problems. This means we'll need to adopt and nurture specific _mindsets_ that will help us as we learn and apply our skills.

## 3.1.2. A Word on Mindsets

Security is not only about understanding technology and code but also about understanding your own mind and that of your adversary. We tend to think of a mindset as _a set of beliefs that inform our personal perspective_ on something.

Two contrasting examples of well-known mindsets are the _fixed_ mindset and the _growth_ mindset.

An individual with a fixed mindset believes that their skill/talent/capacity to learn is what it is and that there is no gain to be made by trying to improve.

On the other hand, a growth mindset encourages the belief that mental ability is flexible and adaptable, and that one can grow their capacity to learn over time.

Research suggests that, for example, a mindset in which we believe ourselves capable of [recovering from a mistake](https://www.psychologicalscience.org/news/releases/how-the-brain-reacts-to-mistakes.html) makes us measurably better at doing so. This is just one aspect of the growth mindset, but it's an important one. This is because security requires us to make mistakes and learn from them and to be constantly learning and re-evaluating.

Another extremely valuable mindset is the aptly coined _security mindset_. Proposed by security researcher [Bruce Schneier](https://www.schneier.com/blog/archives/2008/03/the_security_mi_1.html). This mindset encourages a constant questioning of how one can attack (or defend) a system. If we can begin to ask this question automatically when encountering a novel idea, machine, system, network, or object, we can start noticing a wide array of recurring patterns.

At OffSec, we encourage learners to adopt the [_"Try Harder"_](https://www.offsec.com/offsec/what-it-means-to-try-harder/) mindset. To better understand this mindset, let's quickly consider two potential perspectives in a moment of "failure."

1.  If my attack or defense fails, it represents a truth about my current skills/processes/configurations/approach as much as it is a truth about the system.
    
2.  If my attack or defense fails, this allows me to learn something new, change my approach, and do something differently.
    

These two perspectives help provide someone with the mental fortitude to make mistakes and learn from them, which is essential in any cybersecurity sub-field. More information about how to learn and the Try Harder mindset can be found in the "Effective Learning Strategies" Module that is part of this introductory Learning Path.

## 3.1.3. On Emulating the Minds of our Opponents

It's worth pausing to consider the particular attention that we will give to the [_offensive_](https://mjkranch.com/2019/02/why_we_should_teach_offense_first/) side of security, even in many of our defensive courses and Modules. One might wonder why a cybersecurity professional whose primary interest and goal is defending a network, organization, or government should also learn the offensive side.

Let's take the analogy of a medieval monarch building a castle. If the monarch learns that their enemy has catapults capable of hurling large boulders, they might design their castle to have thicker walls. Similarly, if their enemy is equipped with ladders, the monarch might give their troops tools to push the ladders off the walls.

The more this monarch knows about their would-be attacker and the more they can _think like an attacker_, the better defense they can build. The monarch might engage in "offensive" types of activities or _audits_ to understand the gaps in their own defenses. For example, they could conduct "war games" where they direct their own soldiers to mock-battle each other, helping them fully understand the capabilities and destructive potential of a real attacker.

In cybersecurity, enterprises might hire an individual or a firm to perform a penetration test, also known as a _pentest_. A penetration tester takes on the role of an attacker to better understand the system's vulnerabilities and exposed weaknesses.

Leveraging the skill sets and mindsets of an attacker allows us to better answer questions like:

-   "How might an attacker gain access?"
-   "What can they do with that access?"
-   "What are the worst possible outcomes from an attack?"

While learning hacking skills is (of course) essential for aspiring penetration testers, we also believe that defenders, system administrators, and developers will greatly benefit from at least a cursory education in offensive techniques and technologies as well.

Conversely, it's been our experience that many of the best penetration testers and web application hackers are those who have had extensive exposure to defending networks, building web applications, or administrating systems.

# 3\. Introduction To Cybersecurity

We will cover the following Learning Units in this Learning Module:

-   The Practice of Cybersecurity
-   Threats and Threat Actors
-   The CIA Triad
-   Security Principles, Controls, and Strategies
-   Cybersecurity Laws, Regulations, Standards, and Frameworks
-   Career Opportunities in Cybersecurity

This Module is designed to provide learners, regardless of current proficiency or experience, with a solid understanding of the fundamental principles of cybersecurity. It is intended for a wide range of individuals, from employees working adjacent to information technology or managing technical teams to learners just getting started in the highly dynamic information security field.

Completing this Module will help learners build a useful base of knowledge for progressing onto more technical, hands-on Modules.

An in-depth analysis of each concept is outside the scope of this Module. To learn more about the concepts introduced here, learners are encouraged to progress through the 100-level content in the OffSec Learning Library.

Throughout this Module, we'll examine some recent examples of cyber-attacks and analyze their impact as well as potential prevention or mitigation steps. We'll also supply various links to articles, references, and resources for future exploration. Please review these links for additional context and clarity.

## 3.1. The Practice of Cybersecurity

This Learning Unit covers the following Learning Objectives:

-   Recognize the challenges unique to information security
-   Understand how "offensive" and "defensive" security reflect each other
-   Begin to build a mental model of useful mindsets applicable to information security

## 3.1.1. Challenges in Cybersecurity

Cybersecurity has emerged as a unique discipline and is not a sub-field or niche area of software engineering or system administration. There are a few distinct characteristics of cybersecurity that distinguish it from other technical fields. First, security involves _malicious_ and _intelligent_ actors (i.e. opponents).

The problem of dealing with an intelligent opponent requires a different approach, discipline, and mindset compared to facing a naturally occurring or accidental problem. Whether we are simulating an attack or defending against one, we will need to consider the perspective and potential actions of our opponent and try to anticipate what they might do. Because our opponents are human beings with _agency_, they can reason, predict, judge, analyze, conjecture, and deliberate. They can also feel emotions like happiness, sorrow, greed, fear, triumph, and guilt. Both attackers and defenders can leverage the emotions of their human opponents. For example, an attacker might rely on embarrassment by holding a computer system hostage and threaten to publish its data. Defenders, meanwhile, might leverage fear to dissuade attackers from entering their networks. This reality means human beings are a _critical_ component of cybersecurity.

Another important aspect of security is that it usually involves _reasoning under uncertainty_. Although we have plenty of deductive skills, we are by no means mentally omniscient. We cannot determine _everything_ that follows from a given truth, and we cannot know or remember an infinite number of facts.

Consider how a game like chess is different from a game like poker. In chess, you know everything that your opponent does about the game state (and vice versa). You may not know what they are thinking, but you can make predictions about their next move based on the same information that they are using to determine it. Playing poker, however, you do not have all the information that your opponent possesses, so you must make predictions based on incomplete data.

When considering the mental perspectives of attackers and defenders, information security is a lot closer to poker than chess. For example, when we simulate an attack, we will never know everything there is to know about the machine/system/network/organization we are targeting. We therefore must make assumptions and estimate probabilities, sometimes implicitly and sometimes explicitly.

Defenders, meanwhile, might leverage fear to dissuade attackers from entering their networks. This reality means human beings are a _critical_ component of cybersecurity.

Another important aspect of security is that it usually involves _reasoning under uncertainty_. Although we have plenty of deductive skills, we are by no means mentally omniscient. We cannot determine _everything_ that follows from a given truth, and we cannot know or remember an infinite number of facts.

Consider how a game like chess is different from a game like poker. In chess, you know everything that your opponent does about the game state (and vice versa). You may not know what they are thinking, but you can make predictions about their next move based on the same information that they are using to determine it. Playing poker, however, you do not have all the information that your opponent possesses, so you must make predictions based on incomplete data.

When considering the mental perspectives of attackers and defenders, information security is a lot closer to poker than chess. For example, when we simulate an attack, we will never know everything there is to know about the machine/system/network/organization we are targeting. We therefore must make assumptions and estimate probabilities, sometimes implicitly and sometimes explicitly.

Conversely, as defenders, we will not be aware of every potential attack vector or vulnerability we might be exposed to. We therefore need to hedge our bets and make sure that our attack surfaces that are most likely to be vulnerable are adequately protected.

The problem of the intelligent adversary and the problem of uncertainty both suggest that understanding cybersecurity necessitates learning more about how we _think_ as human agents, and how to solve problems. This means we'll need to adopt and nurture specific _mindsets_ that will help us as we learn and apply our skills.

## 3.1.2. A Word on Mindsets

Security is not only about understanding technology and code but also about understanding your own mind and that of your adversary. We tend to think of a mindset as _a set of beliefs that inform our personal perspective_ on something.

Two contrasting examples of well-known mindsets are the _fixed_ mindset and the _growth_ mindset.

An individual with a fixed mindset believes that their skill/talent/capacity to learn is what it is and that there is no gain to be made by trying to improve.

On the other hand, a growth mindset encourages the belief that mental ability is flexible and adaptable, and that one can grow their capacity to learn over time.

Research suggests that, for example, a mindset in which we believe ourselves capable of [recovering from a mistake](https://www.psychologicalscience.org/news/releases/how-the-brain-reacts-to-mistakes.html) makes us measurably better at doing so. This is just one aspect of the growth mindset, but it's an important one. This is because security requires us to make mistakes and learn from them and to be constantly learning and re-evaluating.

Another extremely valuable mindset is the aptly coined _security mindset_. Proposed by security researcher [Bruce Schneier](https://www.schneier.com/blog/archives/2008/03/the_security_mi_1.html). This mindset encourages a constant questioning of how one can attack (or defend) a system. If we can begin to ask this question automatically when encountering a novel idea, machine, system, network, or object, we can start noticing a wide array of recurring patterns.

At OffSec, we encourage learners to adopt the [_"Try Harder"_](https://www.offsec.com/offsec/what-it-means-to-try-harder/) mindset. To better understand this mindset, let's quickly consider two potential perspectives in a moment of "failure."

1.  If my attack or defense fails, it represents a truth about my current skills/processes/configurations/approach as much as it is a truth about the system.
    
2.  If my attack or defense fails, this allows me to learn something new, change my approach, and do something differently.
    

These two perspectives help provide someone with the mental fortitude to make mistakes and learn from them, which is essential in any cybersecurity sub-field. More information about how to learn and the Try Harder mindset can be found in the "Effective Learning Strategies" Module that is part of this introductory Learning Path.

## 3.1.3. On Emulating the Minds of our Opponents

It's worth pausing to consider the particular attention that we will give to the [_offensive_](https://mjkranch.com/2019/02/why_we_should_teach_offense_first/) side of security, even in many of our defensive courses and Modules. One might wonder why a cybersecurity professional whose primary interest and goal is defending a network, organization, or government should also learn the offensive side.

Let's take the analogy of a medieval monarch building a castle. If the monarch learns that their enemy has catapults capable of hurling large boulders, they might design their castle to have thicker walls. Similarly, if their enemy is equipped with ladders, the monarch might give their troops tools to push the ladders off the walls.

The more this monarch knows about their would-be attacker and the more they can _think like an attacker_, the better defense they can build. The monarch might engage in "offensive" types of activities or _audits_ to understand the gaps in their own defenses. For example, they could conduct "war games" where they direct their own soldiers to mock-battle each other, helping them fully understand the capabilities and destructive potential of a real attacker.

In cybersecurity, enterprises might hire an individual or a firm to perform a penetration test, also known as a _pentest_. A penetration tester takes on the role of an attacker to better understand the system's vulnerabilities and exposed weaknesses.

Leveraging the skill sets and mindsets of an attacker allows us to better answer questions like:

-   "How might an attacker gain access?"
-   "What can they do with that access?"
-   "What are the worst possible outcomes from an attack?"

While learning hacking skills is (of course) essential for aspiring penetration testers, we also believe that defenders, system administrators, and developers will greatly benefit from at least a cursory education in offensive techniques and technologies as well.

Conversely, it's been our experience that many of the best penetration testers and web application hackers are those who have had extensive exposure to defending networks, building web applications, or administrating systems.

## 3.1. The Practice of Cybersecurity

This Learning Unit covers the following Learning Objectives:

-   Recognize the challenges unique to information security
-   Understand how "offensive" and "defensive" security reflect each other
-   Begin to build a mental model of useful mindsets applicable to information security

## 3.1.1. Challenges in Cybersecurity

Cybersecurity has emerged as a unique discipline and is not a sub-field or niche area of software engineering or system administration. There are a few distinct characteristics of cybersecurity that distinguish it from other technical fields. First, security involves _malicious_ and _intelligent_ actors (i.e. opponents).

The problem of dealing with an intelligent opponent requires a different approach, discipline, and mindset compared to facing a naturally occurring or accidental problem. Whether we are simulating an attack or defending against one, we will need to consider the perspective and potential actions of our opponent and try to anticipate what they might do. Because our opponents are human beings with _agency_, they can reason, predict, judge, analyze, conjecture, and deliberate. They can also feel emotions like happiness, sorrow, greed, fear, triumph, and guilt. Both attackers and defenders can leverage the emotions of their human opponents. For example, an attacker might rely on embarrassment by holding a computer system hostage and threaten to publish its data. Defenders, meanwhile, might leverage fear to dissuade attackers from entering their networks. This reality means human beings are a _critical_ component of cybersecurity.

-   Understand how "offensive" and "defensive" security reflect each other
-   Begin to build a mental model of useful mindsets applicable to information security

## 3.1.1. Challenges in Cybersecurity

Cybersecurity has emerged as a unique discipline and is not a sub-field or niche area of software engineering or system administration. There are a few distinct characteristics of cybersecurity that distinguish it from other technical fields. First, security involves _malicious_ and _intelligent_ actors (i.e. opponents).

The problem of dealing with an intelligent opponent requires a different approach, discipline, and mindset compared to facing a naturally occurring or accidental problem. Whether we are simulating an attack or defending against one, we will need to consider the perspective and potential actions of our opponent and try to anticipate what they might do. Because our opponents are human beings with _agency_, they can reason, predict, judge, analyze, conjecture, and deliberate. They can also feel emotions like happiness, sorrow, greed, fear, triumph, and guilt. Both attackers and defenders can leverage the emotions of their human opponents. For example, an attacker might rely on embarrassment by holding a computer system hostage and threaten to publish its data. Defenders, meanwhile, might leverage fear to dissuade attackers from entering their networks. This reality means human beings are a _critical_ component of cybersecurity.

Another important aspect of security is that it usually involves _reasoning under uncertainty_. Although we have plenty of deductive skills, we are by no means mentally omniscient. We cannot determine _everything_ that follows from a given truth, and we cannot know or remember an infinite number of facts.

Consider how a game like chess is different from a game like poker. In chess, you know everything that your opponent does about the game state (and vice versa). You may not know what they are thinking, but you can make predictions about their next move based on the same information that they are using to determine it. Playing poker, however, you do not have all the information that your opponent possesses, so you must make predictions based on incomplete data.

When considering the mental perspectives of attackers and defenders, information security is a lot closer to poker than chess. For example, when we simulate an attack, we will never know everything there is to know about the machine/system/network/organization we are targeting. We therefore must make assumptions and estimate probabilities, sometimes implicitly and sometimes explicitly.

Conversely, as defenders, we will not be aware of every potential attack vector or vulnerability we might be exposed to. We therefore need to hedge our bets and make sure that our attack surfaces that are most likely to be vulnerable are adequately protected.

The problem of the intelligent adversary and the problem of uncertainty both suggest that understanding cybersecurity necessitates learning more about how we _think_ as human agents, and how to solve problems. This means we'll need to adopt and nurture specific _mindsets_ that will help us as we learn and apply our skills.

## 3.1.2. A Word on Mindsets

Security is not only about understanding technology and code but also about understanding your own mind and that of your adversary. We tend to think of a mindset as _a set of beliefs that inform our personal perspective_ on something.

Two contrasting examples of well-known mindsets are the _fixed_ mindset and the _growth_ mindset.

An individual with a fixed mindset believes that their skill/talent/capacity to learn is what it is and that there is no gain to be made by trying to improve.

On the other hand, a growth mindset encourages the belief that mental ability is flexible and adaptable, and that one can grow their capacity to learn over time.

Research suggests that, for example, a mindset in which we believe ourselves capable of [recovering from a mistake](https://www.psychologicalscience.org/news/releases/how-the-brain-reacts-to-mistakes.html) makes us measurably better at doing so. This is just one aspect of the growth mindset, but it's an important one. This is because security requires us to make mistakes and learn from them and to be constantly learning and re-evaluating.

Another extremely valuable mindset is the aptly coined _security mindset_. Proposed by security researcher [Bruce Schneier](https://www.schneier.com/blog/archives/2008/03/the_security_mi_1.html). This mindset encourages a constant questioning of how one can attack (or defend) a system. If we can begin to ask this question automatically when encountering a novel idea, machine, system, network, or object, we can start noticing a wide array of recurring patterns.

At OffSec, we encourage learners to adopt the [_"Try Harder"_](https://www.offsec.com/offsec/what-it-means-to-try-harder/) mindset. To better understand this mindset, let's quickly consider two potential perspectives in a moment of "failure."

1.  If my attack or defense fails, it represents a truth about my current skills/processes/configurations/approach as much as it is a truth about the system.
    
2.  If my attack or defense fails, this allows me to learn something new, change my approach, and do something differently.
    

These two perspectives help provide someone with the mental fortitude to make mistakes and learn from them, which is essential in any cybersecurity sub-field. More information about how to learn and the Try Harder mindset can be found in the "Effective Learning Strategies" Module that is part of this introductory Learning Path.

## 3.1.3. On Emulating the Minds of our Opponents

It's worth pausing to consider the particular attention that we will give to the [_offensive_](https://mjkranch.com/2019/02/why_we_should_teach_offense_first/) side of security, even in many of our defensive courses and Modules. One might wonder why a cybersecurity professional whose primary interest and goal is defending a network, organization, or government should also learn the offensive side.

Let's take the analogy of a medieval monarch building a castle. If the monarch learns that their enemy has catapults capable of hurling large boulders, they might design their castle to have thicker walls. Similarly, if their enemy is equipped with ladders, the monarch might give their troops tools to push the ladders off the walls.

The more this monarch knows about their would-be attacker and the more they can _think like an attacker_, the better defense they can build. The monarch might engage in "offensive" types of activities or _audits_ to understand the gaps in their own defenses. For example, they could conduct "war games" where they direct their own soldiers to mock-battle each other, helping them fully understand the capabilities and destructive potential of a real attacker.

In cybersecurity, enterprises might hire an individual or a firm to perform a penetration test, also known as a _pentest_. A penetration tester takes on the role of an attacker to better understand the system's vulnerabilities and exposed weaknesses.

Leveraging the skill sets and mindsets of an attacker allows us to better answer questions like:

-   "How might an attacker gain access?"
-   "What can they do with that access?"
-   "What are the worst possible outcomes from an attack?"

While learning hacking skills is (of course) essential for aspiring penetration testers, we also believe that defenders, system administrators, and developers will greatly benefit from at least a cursory education in offensive techniques and technologies as well.

Conversely, it's been our experience that many of the best penetration testers and web application hackers are those who have had extensive exposure to defending networks, building web applications, or administrating systems.

## 3.1. The Practice of Cybersecurity

This Learning Unit covers the following Learning Objectives:

-   Recognize the challenges unique to information security
-   Understand how "offensive" and "defensive" security reflect each other
-   Begin to build a mental model of useful mindsets applicable to information security

## 3.1.1. Challenges in Cybersecurity

Cybersecurity has emerged as a unique discipline and is not a sub-field or niche area of software engineering or system administration. There are a few distinct characteristics of cybersecurity that distinguish it from other technical fields. First, security involves _malicious_ and _intelligent_ actors (i.e. opponents).

The problem of dealing with an intelligent opponent requires a different approach, discipline, and mindset compared to facing a naturally occurring or accidental problem. Whether we are simulating an attack or defending against one, we will need to consider the perspective and potential actions of our opponent and try to anticipate what they might do. Because our opponents are human beings with _agency_, they can reason, predict, judge, analyze, conjecture, and deliberate. They can also feel emotions like happiness, sorrow, greed, fear, triumph, and guilt. Both attackers and defenders can leverage the emotions of their human opponents. For example, an attacker might rely on embarrassment by holding a computer system hostage and threaten to publish its data. Defenders, meanwhile, might leverage fear to dissuade attackers from entering their networks. This reality means human beings are a _critical_ component of cybersecurity.

Another important aspect of security is that it usually involves _reasoning under uncertainty_. Although we have plenty of deductive skills, we are by no means mentally omniscient. We cannot determine _everything_ that follows from a given truth, and we cannot know or remember an infinite number of facts.

Consider how a game like chess is different from a game like poker. In chess, you know everything that your opponent does about the game state (and vice versa). You may not know what they are thinking, but you can make predictions about their next move based on the same information that they are using to determine it. Playing poker, however, you do not have all the information that your opponent possesses, so you must make predictions based on incomplete data.

When considering the mental perspectives of attackers and defenders, information security is a lot closer to poker than chess. For example, when we simulate an attack, we will never know everything there is to know about the machine/system/network/organization we are targeting. We therefore must make assumptions and estimate probabilities, sometimes implicitly and sometimes explicitly.

Conversely, as defenders, we will not be aware of every potential attack vector or vulnerability we might be exposed to. We therefore need to hedge our bets and make sure that our attack surfaces that are most likely to be vulnerable are adequately protected.

The problem of the intelligent adversary and the problem of uncertainty both suggest that understanding cybersecurity necessitates learning more about how we _think_ as human agents, and how to solve problems. This means we'll need to adopt and nurture specific _mindsets_ that will help us as we learn and apply our skills.

## 3.1.2. A Word on Mindsets

Security is not only about understanding technology and code but also about understanding your own mind and that of your adversary. We tend to think of a mindset as _a set of beliefs that inform our personal perspective_ on something.

Two contrasting examples of well-known mindsets are the _fixed_ mindset and the _growth_ mindset.

An individual with a fixed mindset believes that their skill/talent/capacity to learn is what it is and that there is no gain to be made by trying to improve.

On the other hand, a growth mindset encourages the belief that mental ability is flexible and adaptable, and that one can grow their capacity to learn over time.

Research suggests that, for example, a mindset in which we believe ourselves capable of [recovering from a mistake](https://www.psychologicalscience.org/news/releases/how-the-brain-reacts-to-mistakes.html) makes us measurably better at doing so. This is just one aspect of the growth mindset, but it's an important one. This is because security requires us to make mistakes and learn from them and to be constantly learning and re-evaluating.

Another extremely valuable mindset is the aptly coined _security mindset_. Proposed by security researcher [Bruce Schneier](https://www.schneier.com/blog/archives/2008/03/the_security_mi_1.html). This mindset encourages a constant questioning of how one can attack (or defend) a system. If we can begin to ask this question automatically when encountering a novel idea, machine, system, network, or object, we can start noticing a wide array of recurring patterns.

At OffSec, we encourage learners to adopt the [_"Try Harder"_](https://www.offsec.com/offsec/what-it-means-to-try-harder/) mindset. To better understand this mindset, let's quickly consider two potential perspectives in a moment of "failure."

1.  If my attack or defense fails, it represents a truth about my current skills/processes/configurations/approach as much as it is a truth about the system.
    
2.  If my attack or defense fails, this allows me to learn something new, change my approach, and do something differently.
    

These two perspectives help provide someone with the mental fortitude to make mistakes and learn from them, which is essential in any cybersecurity sub-field. More information about how to learn and the Try Harder mindset can be found in the "Effective Learning Strategies" Module that is part of this introductory Learning Path.

## 3.1.3. On Emulating the Minds of our Opponents

It's worth pausing to consider the particular attention that we will give to the [_offensive_](https://mjkranch.com/2019/02/why_we_should_teach_offense_first/) side of security, even in many of our defensive courses and Modules. One might wonder why a cybersecurity professional whose primary interest and goal is defending a network, organization, or government should also learn the offensive side.

Let's take the analogy of a medieval monarch building a castle. If the monarch learns that their enemy has catapults capable of hurling large boulders, they might design their castle to have thicker walls. Similarly, if their enemy is equipped with ladders, the monarch might give their troops tools to push the ladders off the walls.

The more this monarch knows about their would-be attacker and the more they can _think like an attacker_, the better defense they can build. The monarch might engage in "offensive" types of activities or _audits_ to understand the gaps in their own defenses. For example, they could conduct "war games" where they direct their own soldiers to mock-battle each other, helping them fully understand the capabilities and destructive potential of a real attacker.

In cybersecurity, enterprises might hire an individual or a firm to perform a penetration test, also known as a _pentest_. A penetration tester takes on the role of an attacker to better understand the system's vulnerabilities and exposed weaknesses.

Leveraging the skill sets and mindsets of an attacker allows us to better answer questions like:

-   "How might an attacker gain access?"
-   "What can they do with that access?"
-   "What are the worst possible outcomes from an attack?"

While learning hacking skills is (of course) essential for aspiring penetration testers, we also believe that defenders, system administrators, and developers will greatly benefit from at least a cursory education in offensive techniques and technologies as well.

Conversely, it's been our experience that many of the best penetration testers and web application hackers are those who have had extensive exposure to defending networks, building web applications, or administrating systems.
