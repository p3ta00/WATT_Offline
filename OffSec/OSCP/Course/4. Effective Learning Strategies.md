# 4\. Effective Learning Strategies

This Learning Module is intended to provide learners with a better understanding of learning strategies as well as a preview of the OffSec instruction style and what to expect. After completing this Module, learners should be able to effectively plan how to best approach the coursework ahead.

Let's briefly review why this is an important Module. The information covered will not only help learners prepare to succeed in the training ahead but will also be useful to cyber security professionals in the long term. Since both technology and the security landscape are constantly evolving and changing (we'll explore this more later), professionals must continually learn and grow. Finding success and satisfaction in this field is often tied to our ability to become efficient and comfortable learners.

We will cover the following Learning Units in this Learning Module:

-   Learning Theory
-   Unique Challenges to Learning Technical Skills
-   The OffSec Training Methodology
-   A Case Study Regarding Executable Permission
-   Common Methods and Strategies
-   Advice and Suggestions on Exams
-   Practical Steps

## 4.1. Learning Theory

Let's begin with a very basic discussion of Learning Theory. We'll make some general observations about this field of study and examine the current state of our (constantly evolving) understanding of how learners learn.

In general, this Learning Unit and the next will illuminate some of the problems and difficulties that individuals face when learning new subjects.

This Learning Unit covers the following Learning Objectives:

-   Understand the general state of our understanding of education and education theory
-   Understand the basics of memory mechanisms and dual encoding
-   Recognize some of the problems faced by learners, including "The Curve of Forgetting" and cognitive load

## 4.1.1. What We Know and What We Don't

Although we humans have always taught, we have only recently (within the past 100 years) begun researching [learning theory](https://www.encyclopedia.com/psychology/encyclopedias-almanacs-transcripts-and-maps/learning-theory-history).

Some of this research focuses on the structure and purpose of schools themselves. For example, a great deal of research ponders the [ideal classroom size](https://www.hmhco.com/blog/class-size-matters), whether activities in gym class can help a learner in [science class](https://www.publicschoolreview.com/blog/the-pros-and-cons-of-mandatory-gym-class-in-public-schools), and so on. Although these studies may not initially seem relevant to our focus on cyber security, a few key aspects of this research are worth mentioning.

First, learning is not entirely dependent on the learner. The teacher, the material, the education format, and a variety of other factors affect success more than a learner's raw capability. A learner's past performance is a [poor predictor](https://cew.georgetown.edu/wp-content/uploads/FR-Born_to_win-schooled_to_lose.pdf) of future success, and external events and circumstances can drastically affect a [learner's performance](https://www.wbur.org/hereandnow/2018/08/27/public-private-school-family-income-study).

Second, as new educational studies are constantly released, it's clear there's still much to be discovered about the mechanics of our memory. This includes research suggesting that the notion of learning modes (or learning styles) is more of a myth than previously thought.

Two excellent articles about this are:

-   American Psychological Association - [Belief in Learning Styles Myth May Be Detrimental](https://www.apa.org/news/press/releases/2019/05/learning-styles-myth)
-   Scientific American - [The Problem with "Learning Styles"](https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/the-problem-with-learning-styles/)

At OffSec we design our courses around current, established academic research regarding learning theory, because we aim to be perpetual learners. We research current research and are constantly seeking to improve our methods.

As instructors, our goal is to create a highly effective learning environment that equips learners to excel in the ever-changing field of information security, regardless of past experience or performance in the field.

However, before we can discuss more practical strategies, let's explore some of the current research in the field of learning theory to understand how it's best applied.

## 4.1.2. Memory Mechanisms and Dual Coding

It can be a bit overwhelming to think of education, so let's try to understand it in more simple terms first. One of the ways we can demonstrate that we've "learned" something is if we can create and retrieve a memory.

For example, we might learn a specific command to rename a file in Linux, **mv oldfilename.txt newfilename.txt**. Later, we might find ourselves at a computer, needing to rename a file. We hope that in that situation, away from our textbook and any instructional material, we'll remember this command and syntax. Ideally, we can enter the command from memory and successfully rename the file.

A great deal of research has gone into [how memory works](https://web.archive.org/web/20230728172131/https://bokcenter.harvard.edu/how-memory-works) and how we create strong memories and learn new skills. A full review of all the details is out of scope of this Module, but in short, we might summarize by saying that we can improve memory by doing the following:

1.  Improve the quality of information we take in
2.  Improve the way or mode in which we receive information
3.  Improve our practice of retrieving information

We will explore all these more shortly, but for now, let's review them quickly:

-   _Improve the quality of information we take in:_ At a basic level, we expect our training material to be accurate. We might need explanatory paragraphs (like this one), written in a simple, easy-to-understand manner. This responsibility generally falls to the instructor or training provider.
    
-   _Improve the way or mode in which we receive information:_ This could include multiple approaches. Information might be more easily retained if presented in multiple formats, such as videos or images. This might also include a distraction-free environment for the learner.
    
-   _Improve our practice of retrieving information:_ This may seem like merely exam practice at first, but there's more to it than that. A learner who reads a paragraph about how to create a file and then follows along to create a file independently is working on memory retrieval.
    

The more we work to improve in these three areas, the better we will be at remembering and learning. We also know that repeating information while changing the delivery mode can also be helpful.

Taking in the same information via a secondary method, for example, reading an explanation and then watching a video about the same Module, is called _Dual Coding_. The basic principle behind Dual Coding is that repeatedly studying the same information through different means improves retention.

![Figure 1: Dual Coding](https://static.offsec.com/offsec-courses/LIBRARY/imgs//Effective_Learning_Strategies/29562e738cdf2e993d7684619e36e3c9-dualencoding.png)

Figure 1: Dual Coding

The image shown above is more than just an illustration of Dual Coding; it is an example of Dual Coding itself. By combining the text paragraph explaining the process of reading about a concept and combining it with explanatory visual aids, the information is better imprinted into our brains.

There is an increasing amount of research, including repeatable experiments and evidence from neuroimaging, that supports [Dual Coding as an effective learning strategy](https://sciencebasedmedicine.org/brain-based-learning-myth-versus-reality-testing-learning-styles-and-dual-coding/).

## 4.1.3. The Forgetting Curve and Cognitive Load

In a [fictional tale by Jorge Luis Borges](http://vigeland.caltech.edu/ist4/lectures/funes%20borges.pdf), a character named Funes the Memorious could remember in vivid detail every single thing he witnessed. Unfortunately, most of us aren't blessed with this gift. Two of the most common problems we encounter when trying to learn something (or create a memory) are "too long ago" or "too much information at once".

Let's start by examining the problem of forgetting. In 1885, learning scientist Hermann Ebbinghaus set out to memorize a few documents, then tested himself repeatedly on what he remembered. He was only able to remember all the details if he tested himself immediately after memorizing. Ebbinghaus found he only remembered 100 percent of the information at the time of acquisition. After that, he started forgetting information very quickly. When he waited 20 minutes, he could only remember 58%. A day later, he could only remember 23%. He called this decline [_The Forgetting Curve_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forgetting_curve).

![Figure 2: Ebbinghaus' Forgetting Curve](https://static.offsec.com/offsec-courses/LIBRARY/imgs//Effective_Learning_Strategies/9d8d2a0e29d0c9e0ac20b38bd00b34f0-ebbinghaus.png)

Figure 2: Ebbinghaus' Forgetting Curve

Thankfully, almost 150 years later, most of us have [search engines](https://www.inkling.com/blog/2015/08/why-google-changed-forgetting-curve/) and other tools available to us that Ebbinghaus did not. For example, if we forget the specific command to rename a file in Linux, such as **mv oldfilename.txt newfilename.txt**, we can quickly and easily Google it.

This is great news since it means our learning approach doesn't need to be centered around memorizing facts. Instead, we can shift our focus to learning a method (in this case, our method might be to Google the command we need).

The second problem, which we've referred to as "too much information at once", is usually referred to as [_Cognitive Load_](https://www.educationcorner.com/cognitive-load-theory/).

To better understand cognitive load, it may be helpful to imagine our brain as sort of a room, with pieces of information (that take up space) moving in and out. At some point, if more and more information keep coming in, there simply isn't enough space for everything to stay organized. Soon, the room is too full and there isn't enough space for more to come in through the door.

To remedy this, instructors may try reducing what is called "extraneous load." These are extra pieces of new information that aren't important or necessary.

Let's go back to our example of renaming a file. Imagine that our instructor also explained that this command is the same as the command we might use if we wanted to change the location of the file to the exact same directory and then give it a new name. While technically true, this bit of information would not improve our understanding of renaming files. Instead, trying to understand that "relocating something to its original location" might take up additional mental capacity, impeding our learning.

It's easy to imagine how disorganized instructional materials might increase cognitive load, but the same is also true for the classroom or environment where the learner is physically located. A noisy coffee shop is full of smells, conversations, people, and movement--all of which our brains are constantly taking in. In the case of online learning, learners may need to reduce the extraneous load in the physical learning space itself. We'll explore this more later.

Let's take an opportunity to pause briefly and review some of what we've learned so far with a series of questions.

# 4\. Effective Learning Strategies

This Learning Module is intended to provide learners with a better understanding of learning strategies as well as a preview of the OffSec instruction style and what to expect. After completing this Module, learners should be able to effectively plan how to best approach the coursework ahead.

Let's briefly review why this is an important Module. The information covered will not only help learners prepare to succeed in the training ahead but will also be useful to cyber security professionals in the long term. Since both technology and the security landscape are constantly evolving and changing (we'll explore this more later), professionals must continually learn and grow. Finding success and satisfaction in this field is often tied to our ability to become efficient and comfortable learners.

We will cover the following Learning Units in this Learning Module:

-   Learning Theory
-   Unique Challenges to Learning Technical Skills
-   The OffSec Training Methodology
-   A Case Study Regarding Executable Permission
-   Common Methods and Strategies
-   Advice and Suggestions on Exams
-   Practical Steps

## 4.1. Learning Theory

Let's begin with a very basic discussion of Learning Theory. We'll make some general observations about this field of study and examine the current state of our (constantly evolving) understanding of how learners learn.

In general, this Learning Unit and the next will illuminate some of the problems and difficulties that individuals face when learning new subjects.

This Learning Unit covers the following Learning Objectives:

-   Understand the general state of our understanding of education and education theory
-   Understand the basics of memory mechanisms and dual encoding
-   Recognize some of the problems faced by learners, including "The Curve of Forgetting" and cognitive load

## 4.1.1. What We Know and What We Don't

Although we humans have always taught, we have only recently (within the past 100 years) begun researching [learning theory](https://www.encyclopedia.com/psychology/encyclopedias-almanacs-transcripts-and-maps/learning-theory-history).

Some of this research focuses on the structure and purpose of schools themselves. For example, a great deal of research ponders the [ideal classroom size](https://www.hmhco.com/blog/class-size-matters), whether activities in gym class can help a learner in [science class](https://www.publicschoolreview.com/blog/the-pros-and-cons-of-mandatory-gym-class-in-public-schools), and so on. Although these studies may not initially seem relevant to our focus on cyber security, a few key aspects of this research are worth mentioning.

First, learning is not entirely dependent on the learner. The teacher, the material, the education format, and a variety of other factors affect success more than a learner's raw capability. A learner's past performance is a [poor predictor](https://cew.georgetown.edu/wp-content/uploads/FR-Born_to_win-schooled_to_lose.pdf) of future success, and external events and circumstances can drastically affect a [learner's performance](https://www.wbur.org/hereandnow/2018/08/27/public-private-school-family-income-study).

Second, as new educational studies are constantly released, it's clear there's still much to be discovered about the mechanics of our memory. This includes research suggesting that the notion of learning modes (or learning styles) is more of a myth than previously thought.

Two excellent articles about this are:

-   American Psychological Association - [Belief in Learning Styles Myth May Be Detrimental](https://www.apa.org/news/press/releases/2019/05/learning-styles-myth)
-   Scientific American - [The Problem with "Learning Styles"](https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/the-problem-with-learning-styles/)

At OffSec we design our courses around current, established academic research regarding learning theory, because we aim to be perpetual learners. We research current research and are constantly seeking to improve our methods.

As instructors, our goal is to create a highly effective learning environment that equips learners to excel in the ever-changing field of information security, regardless of past experience or performance in the field.

However, before we can discuss more practical strategies, let's explore some of the current research in the field of learning theory to understand how it's best applied.

## 4.1.2. Memory Mechanisms and Dual Coding

It can be a bit overwhelming to think of education, so let's try to understand it in more simple terms first. One of the ways we can demonstrate that we've "learned" something is if we can create and retrieve a memory.

For example, we might learn a specific command to rename a file in Linux, **mv oldfilename.txt newfilename.txt**. Later, we might find ourselves at a computer, needing to rename a file. We hope that in that situation, away from our textbook and any instructional material, we'll remember this command and syntax. Ideally, we can enter the command from memory and successfully rename the file.

A great deal of research has gone into [how memory works](https://web.archive.org/web/20230728172131/https://bokcenter.harvard.edu/how-memory-works) and how we create strong memories and learn new skills. A full review of all the details is out of scope of this Module, but in short, we might summarize by saying that we can improve memory by doing the following:

1.  Improve the quality of information we take in
2.  Improve the way or mode in which we receive information
3.  Improve our practice of retrieving information

We will explore all these more shortly, but for now, let's review them quickly:

-   _Improve the quality of information we take in:_ At a basic level, we expect our training material to be accurate. We might need explanatory paragraphs (like this one), written in a simple, easy-to-understand manner. This responsibility generally falls to the instructor or training provider.
    
-   _Improve the way or mode in which we receive information:_ This could include multiple approaches. Information might be more easily retained if presented in multiple formats, such as videos or images. This might also include a distraction-free environment for the learner.
    
-   _Improve our practice of retrieving information:_ This may seem like merely exam practice at first, but there's more to it than that. A learner who reads a paragraph about how to create a file and then follows along to create a file independently is working on memory retrieval.
    

The more we work to improve in these three areas, the better we will be at remembering and learning. We also know that repeating information while changing the delivery mode can also be helpful.

Taking in the same information via a secondary method, for example, reading an explanation and then watching a video about the same Module, is called _Dual Coding_. The basic principle behind Dual Coding is that repeatedly studying the same information through different means improves retention.

![Figure 1: Dual Coding](https://static.offsec.com/offsec-courses/LIBRARY/imgs//Effective_Learning_Strategies/29562e738cdf2e993d7684619e36e3c9-dualencoding.png)

Figure 1: Dual Coding

The image shown above is more than just an illustration of Dual Coding; it is an example of Dual Coding itself. By combining the text paragraph explaining the process of reading about a concept and combining it with explanatory visual aids, the information is better imprinted into our brains.

There is an increasing amount of research, including repeatable experiments and evidence from neuroimaging, that supports [Dual Coding as an effective learning strategy](https://sciencebasedmedicine.org/brain-based-learning-myth-versus-reality-testing-learning-styles-and-dual-coding/).

## 4.1.3. The Forgetting Curve and Cognitive Load

In a [fictional tale by Jorge Luis Borges](http://vigeland.caltech.edu/ist4/lectures/funes%20borges.pdf), a character named Funes the Memorious could remember in vivid detail every single thing he witnessed. Unfortunately, most of us aren't blessed with this gift. Two of the most common problems we encounter when trying to learn something (or create a memory) are "too long ago" or "too much information at once".

Let's start by examining the problem of forgetting. In 1885, learning scientist Hermann Ebbinghaus set out to memorize a few documents, then tested himself repeatedly on what he remembered. He was only able to remember all the details if he tested himself immediately after memorizing. Ebbinghaus found he only remembered 100 percent of the information at the time of acquisition. After that, he started forgetting information very quickly. When he waited 20 minutes, he could only remember 58%. A day later, he could only remember 23%. He called this decline [_The Forgetting Curve_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forgetting_curve).

![Figure 2: Ebbinghaus' Forgetting Curve](https://static.offsec.com/offsec-courses/LIBRARY/imgs//Effective_Learning_Strategies/9d8d2a0e29d0c9e0ac20b38bd00b34f0-ebbinghaus.png)

Figure 2: Ebbinghaus' Forgetting Curve

Thankfully, almost 150 years later, most of us have [search engines](https://www.inkling.com/blog/2015/08/why-google-changed-forgetting-curve/) and other tools available to us that Ebbinghaus did not. For example, if we forget the specific command to rename a file in Linux, such as **mv oldfilename.txt newfilename.txt**, we can quickly and easily Google it.

This is great news since it means our learning approach doesn't need to be centered around memorizing facts. Instead, we can shift our focus to learning a method (in this case, our method might be to Google the command we need).

The second problem, which we've referred to as "too much information at once", is usually referred to as [_Cognitive Load_](https://www.educationcorner.com/cognitive-load-theory/).

To better understand cognitive load, it may be helpful to imagine our brain as sort of a room, with pieces of information (that take up space) moving in and out. At some point, if more and more information keep coming in, there simply isn't enough space for everything to stay organized. Soon, the room is too full and there isn't enough space for more to come in through the door.

To remedy this, instructors may try reducing what is called "extraneous load." These are extra pieces of new information that aren't important or necessary.

Let's go back to our example of renaming a file. Imagine that our instructor also explained that this command is the same as the command we might use if we wanted to change the location of the file to the exact same directory and then give it a new name. While technically true, this bit of information would not improve our understanding of renaming files. Instead, trying to understand that "relocating something to its original location" might take up additional mental capacity, impeding our learning.

This is great news since it means our learning approach doesn't need to be centered around memorizing facts. Instead, we can shift our focus to learning a method (in this case, our method might be to Google the command we need).

The second problem, which we've referred to as "too much information at once", is usually referred to as [_Cognitive Load_](https://www.educationcorner.com/cognitive-load-theory/).

To better understand cognitive load, it may be helpful to imagine our brain as sort of a room, with pieces of information (that take up space) moving in and out. At some point, if more and more information keep coming in, there simply isn't enough space for everything to stay organized. Soon, the room is too full and there isn't enough space for more to come in through the door.

To remedy this, instructors may try reducing what is called "extraneous load." These are extra pieces of new information that aren't important or necessary.

Let's go back to our example of renaming a file. Imagine that our instructor also explained that this command is the same as the command we might use if we wanted to change the location of the file to the exact same directory and then give it a new name. While technically true, this bit of information would not improve our understanding of renaming files. Instead, trying to understand that "relocating something to its original location" might take up additional mental capacity, impeding our learning.

It's easy to imagine how disorganized instructional materials might increase cognitive load, but the same is also true for the classroom or environment where the learner is physically located. A noisy coffee shop is full of smells, conversations, people, and movement--all of which our brains are constantly taking in. In the case of online learning, learners may need to reduce the extraneous load in the physical learning space itself. We'll explore this more later.

Let's take an opportunity to pause briefly and review some of what we've learned so far with a series of questions.

# 4\. Effective Learning Strategies

This Learning Module is intended to provide learners with a better understanding of learning strategies as well as a preview of the OffSec instruction style and what to expect. After completing this Module, learners should be able to effectively plan how to best approach the coursework ahead.

Let's briefly review why this is an important Module. The information covered will not only help learners prepare to succeed in the training ahead but will also be useful to cyber security professionals in the long term. Since both technology and the security landscape are constantly evolving and changing (we'll explore this more later), professionals must continually learn and grow. Finding success and satisfaction in this field is often tied to our ability to become efficient and comfortable learners.

We will cover the following Learning Units in this Learning Module:

-   Learning Theory
-   Unique Challenges to Learning Technical Skills
-   The OffSec Training Methodology
-   A Case Study Regarding Executable Permission
-   Common Methods and Strategies
-   Advice and Suggestions on Exams
-   Practical Steps

## 4.1. Learning Theory

Let's begin with a very basic discussion of Learning Theory. We'll make some general observations about this field of study and examine the current state of our (constantly evolving) understanding of how learners learn.

In general, this Learning Unit and the next will illuminate some of the problems and difficulties that individuals face when learning new subjects.

This Learning Unit covers the following Learning Objectives:

-   Understand the general state of our understanding of education and education theory
-   Understand the basics of memory mechanisms and dual encoding
-   Recognize some of the problems faced by learners, including "The Curve of Forgetting" and cognitive load

## 4.1.1. What We Know and What We Don't

Although we humans have always taught, we have only recently (within the past 100 years) begun researching [learning theory](https://www.encyclopedia.com/psychology/encyclopedias-almanacs-transcripts-and-maps/learning-theory-history).

Some of this research focuses on the structure and purpose of schools themselves. For example, a great deal of research ponders the [ideal classroom size](https://www.hmhco.com/blog/class-size-matters), whether activities in gym class can help a learner in [science class](https://www.publicschoolreview.com/blog/the-pros-and-cons-of-mandatory-gym-class-in-public-schools), and so on. Although these studies may not initially seem relevant to our focus on cyber security, a few key aspects of this research are worth mentioning.

First, learning is not entirely dependent on the learner. The teacher, the material, the education format, and a variety of other factors affect success more than a learner's raw capability. A learner's past performance is a [poor predictor](https://cew.georgetown.edu/wp-content/uploads/FR-Born_to_win-schooled_to_lose.pdf) of future success, and external events and circumstances can drastically affect a [learner's performance](https://www.wbur.org/hereandnow/2018/08/27/public-private-school-family-income-study).

Second, as new educational studies are constantly released, it's clear there's still much to be discovered about the mechanics of our memory. This includes research suggesting that the notion of learning modes (or learning styles) is more of a myth than previously thought.

Two excellent articles about this are:

-   American Psychological Association - [Belief in Learning Styles Myth May Be Detrimental](https://www.apa.org/news/press/releases/2019/05/learning-styles-myth)
-   Scientific American - [The Problem with "Learning Styles"](https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/the-problem-with-learning-styles/)

At OffSec we design our courses around current, established academic research regarding learning theory, because we aim to be perpetual learners. We research current research and are constantly seeking to improve our methods.

As instructors, our goal is to create a highly effective learning environment that equips learners to excel in the ever-changing field of information security, regardless of past experience or performance in the field.

However, before we can discuss more practical strategies, let's explore some of the current research in the field of learning theory to understand how it's best applied.

## 4.1.2. Memory Mechanisms and Dual Coding

It can be a bit overwhelming to think of education, so let's try to understand it in more simple terms first. One of the ways we can demonstrate that we've "learned" something is if we can create and retrieve a memory.

For example, we might learn a specific command to rename a file in Linux, **mv oldfilename.txt newfilename.txt**. Later, we might find ourselves at a computer, needing to rename a file. We hope that in that situation, away from our textbook and any instructional material, we'll remember this command and syntax. Ideally, we can enter the command from memory and successfully rename the file.

A great deal of research has gone into [how memory works](https://web.archive.org/web/20230728172131/https://bokcenter.harvard.edu/how-memory-works) and how we create strong memories and learn new skills. A full review of all the details is out of scope of this Module, but in short, we might summarize by saying that we can improve memory by doing the following:

1.  Improve the quality of information we take in
2.  Improve the way or mode in which we receive information
3.  Improve our practice of retrieving information

We will explore all these more shortly, but for now, let's review them quickly:

-   _Improve the quality of information we take in:_ At a basic level, we expect our training material to be accurate. We might need explanatory paragraphs (like this one), written in a simple, easy-to-understand manner. This responsibility generally falls to the instructor or training provider.
    
-   _Improve the way or mode in which we receive information:_ This could include multiple approaches. Information might be more easily retained if presented in multiple formats, such as videos or images. This might also include a distraction-free environment for the learner.
    
-   _Improve our practice of retrieving information:_ This may seem like merely exam practice at first, but there's more to it than that. A learner who reads a paragraph about how to create a file and then follows along to create a file independently is working on memory retrieval.
    

The more we work to improve in these three areas, the better we will be at remembering and learning. We also know that repeating information while changing the delivery mode can also be helpful.

Taking in the same information via a secondary method, for example, reading an explanation and then watching a video about the same Module, is called _Dual Coding_. The basic principle behind Dual Coding is that repeatedly studying the same information through different means improves retention.

![Figure 1: Dual Coding](https://static.offsec.com/offsec-courses/LIBRARY/imgs//Effective_Learning_Strategies/29562e738cdf2e993d7684619e36e3c9-dualencoding.png)

Figure 1: Dual Coding

The image shown above is more than just an illustration of Dual Coding; it is an example of Dual Coding itself. By combining the text paragraph explaining the process of reading about a concept and combining it with explanatory visual aids, the information is better imprinted into our brains.

There is an increasing amount of research, including repeatable experiments and evidence from neuroimaging, that supports [Dual Coding as an effective learning strategy](https://sciencebasedmedicine.org/brain-based-learning-myth-versus-reality-testing-learning-styles-and-dual-coding/).

## 4.1.3. The Forgetting Curve and Cognitive Load

In a [fictional tale by Jorge Luis Borges](http://vigeland.caltech.edu/ist4/lectures/funes%20borges.pdf), a character named Funes the Memorious could remember in vivid detail every single thing he witnessed. Unfortunately, most of us aren't blessed with this gift. Two of the most common problems we encounter when trying to learn something (or create a memory) are "too long ago" or "too much information at once".

Let's start by examining the problem of forgetting. In 1885, learning scientist Hermann Ebbinghaus set out to memorize a few documents, then tested himself repeatedly on what he remembered. He was only able to remember all the details if he tested himself immediately after memorizing. Ebbinghaus found he only remembered 100 percent of the information at the time of acquisition. After that, he started forgetting information very quickly. When he waited 20 minutes, he could only remember 58%. A day later, he could only remember 23%. He called this decline [_The Forgetting Curve_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forgetting_curve).

![Figure 2: Ebbinghaus' Forgetting Curve](https://static.offsec.com/offsec-courses/LIBRARY/imgs//Effective_Learning_Strategies/9d8d2a0e29d0c9e0ac20b38bd00b34f0-ebbinghaus.png)

Figure 2: Ebbinghaus' Forgetting Curve

Thankfully, almost 150 years later, most of us have [search engines](https://www.inkling.com/blog/2015/08/why-google-changed-forgetting-curve/) and other tools available to us that Ebbinghaus did not. For example, if we forget the specific command to rename a file in Linux, such as **mv oldfilename.txt newfilename.txt**, we can quickly and easily Google it.

Let's start by examining the problem of forgetting. In 1885, learning scientist Hermann Ebbinghaus set out to memorize a few documents, then tested himself repeatedly on what he remembered. He was only able to remember all the details if he tested himself immediately after memorizing. Ebbinghaus found he only remembered 100 percent of the information at the time of acquisition. After that, he started forgetting information very quickly. When he waited 20 minutes, he could only remember 58%. A day later, he could only remember 23%. He called this decline [_The Forgetting Curve_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forgetting_curve).

![Figure 2: Ebbinghaus' Forgetting Curve](https://static.offsec.com/offsec-courses/LIBRARY/imgs//Effective_Learning_Strategies/9d8d2a0e29d0c9e0ac20b38bd00b34f0-ebbinghaus.png)

Figure 2: Ebbinghaus' Forgetting Curve

Thankfully, almost 150 years later, most of us have [search engines](https://www.inkling.com/blog/2015/08/why-google-changed-forgetting-curve/) and other tools available to us that Ebbinghaus did not. For example, if we forget the specific command to rename a file in Linux, such as **mv oldfilename.txt newfilename.txt**, we can quickly and easily Google it.

This is great news since it means our learning approach doesn't need to be centered around memorizing facts. Instead, we can shift our focus to learning a method (in this case, our method might be to Google the command we need).

The second problem, which we've referred to as "too much information at once", is usually referred to as [_Cognitive Load_](https://www.educationcorner.com/cognitive-load-theory/).

To better understand cognitive load, it may be helpful to imagine our brain as sort of a room, with pieces of information (that take up space) moving in and out. At some point, if more and more information keep coming in, there simply isn't enough space for everything to stay organized. Soon, the room is too full and there isn't enough space for more to come in through the door.

To remedy this, instructors may try reducing what is called "extraneous load." These are extra pieces of new information that aren't important or necessary.

Let's go back to our example of renaming a file. Imagine that our instructor also explained that this command is the same as the command we might use if we wanted to change the location of the file to the exact same directory and then give it a new name. While technically true, this bit of information would not improve our understanding of renaming files. Instead, trying to understand that "relocating something to its original location" might take up additional mental capacity, impeding our learning.

It's easy to imagine how disorganized instructional materials might increase cognitive load, but the same is also true for the classroom or environment where the learner is physically located. A noisy coffee shop is full of smells, conversations, people, and movement--all of which our brains are constantly taking in. In the case of online learning, learners may need to reduce the extraneous load in the physical learning space itself. We'll explore this more later.

Let's take an opportunity to pause briefly and review some of what we've learned so far with a series of questions.

# 4\. Effective Learning Strategies

This Learning Module is intended to provide learners with a better understanding of learning strategies as well as a preview of the OffSec instruction style and what to expect. After completing this Module, learners should be able to effectively plan how to best approach the coursework ahead.

Let's briefly review why this is an important Module. The information covered will not only help learners prepare to succeed in the training ahead but will also be useful to cyber security professionals in the long term. Since both technology and the security landscape are constantly evolving and changing (we'll explore this more later), professionals must continually learn and grow. Finding success and satisfaction in this field is often tied to our ability to become efficient and comfortable learners.

We will cover the following Learning Units in this Learning Module:

-   Learning Theory
-   Unique Challenges to Learning Technical Skills
-   The OffSec Training Methodology
-   A Case Study Regarding Executable Permission
-   Common Methods and Strategies
-   Advice and Suggestions on Exams
-   Practical Steps

## 4.1. Learning Theory

Let's begin with a very basic discussion of Learning Theory. We'll make some general observations about this field of study and examine the current state of our (constantly evolving) understanding of how learners learn.

In general, this Learning Unit and the next will illuminate some of the problems and difficulties that individuals face when learning new subjects.

This Learning Unit covers the following Learning Objectives:

-   Understand the general state of our understanding of education and education theory
-   Understand the basics of memory mechanisms and dual encoding
-   Recognize some of the problems faced by learners, including "The Curve of Forgetting" and cognitive load

## 4.1.1. What We Know and What We Don't

Although we humans have always taught, we have only recently (within the past 100 years) begun researching [learning theory](https://www.encyclopedia.com/psychology/encyclopedias-almanacs-transcripts-and-maps/learning-theory-history).

Some of this research focuses on the structure and purpose of schools themselves. For example, a great deal of research ponders the [ideal classroom size](https://www.hmhco.com/blog/class-size-matters), whether activities in gym class can help a learner in [science class](https://www.publicschoolreview.com/blog/the-pros-and-cons-of-mandatory-gym-class-in-public-schools), and so on. Although these studies may not initially seem relevant to our focus on cyber security, a few key aspects of this research are worth mentioning.

First, learning is not entirely dependent on the learner. The teacher, the material, the education format, and a variety of other factors affect success more than a learner's raw capability. A learner's past performance is a [poor predictor](https://cew.georgetown.edu/wp-content/uploads/FR-Born_to_win-schooled_to_lose.pdf) of future success, and external events and circumstances can drastically affect a [learner's performance](https://www.wbur.org/hereandnow/2018/08/27/public-private-school-family-income-study).

Second, as new educational studies are constantly released, it's clear there's still much to be discovered about the mechanics of our memory. This includes research suggesting that the notion of learning modes (or learning styles) is more of a myth than previously thought.

Two excellent articles about this are:

-   American Psychological Association - [Belief in Learning Styles Myth May Be Detrimental](https://www.apa.org/news/press/releases/2019/05/learning-styles-myth)
-   Scientific American - [The Problem with "Learning Styles"](https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/the-problem-with-learning-styles/)

At OffSec we design our courses around current, established academic research regarding learning theory, because we aim to be perpetual learners. We research current research and are constantly seeking to improve our methods.

As instructors, our goal is to create a highly effective learning environment that equips learners to excel in the ever-changing field of information security, regardless of past experience or performance in the field.

However, before we can discuss more practical strategies, let's explore some of the current research in the field of learning theory to understand how it's best applied.

## 4.1.2. Memory Mechanisms and Dual Coding

It can be a bit overwhelming to think of education, so let's try to understand it in more simple terms first. One of the ways we can demonstrate that we've "learned" something is if we can create and retrieve a memory.

For example, we might learn a specific command to rename a file in Linux, **mv oldfilename.txt newfilename.txt**. Later, we might find ourselves at a computer, needing to rename a file. We hope that in that situation, away from our textbook and any instructional material, we'll remember this command and syntax. Ideally, we can enter the command from memory and successfully rename the file.

A great deal of research has gone into [how memory works](https://web.archive.org/web/20230728172131/https://bokcenter.harvard.edu/how-memory-works) and how we create strong memories and learn new skills. A full review of all the details is out of scope of this Module, but in short, we might summarize by saying that we can improve memory by doing the following:

1.  Improve the quality of information we take in
2.  Improve the way or mode in which we receive information
3.  Improve our practice of retrieving information

We will explore all these more shortly, but for now, let's review them quickly:

-   _Improve the quality of information we take in:_ At a basic level, we expect our training material to be accurate. We might need explanatory paragraphs (like this one), written in a simple, easy-to-understand manner. This responsibility generally falls to the instructor or training provider.
    
-   _Improve the way or mode in which we receive information:_ This could include multiple approaches. Information might be more easily retained if presented in multiple formats, such as videos or images. This might also include a distraction-free environment for the learner.
    
-   _Improve our practice of retrieving information:_ This may seem like merely exam practice at first, but there's more to it than that. A learner who reads a paragraph about how to create a file and then follows along to create a file independently is working on memory retrieval.
    

The more we work to improve in these three areas, the better we will be at remembering and learning. We also know that repeating information while changing the delivery mode can also be helpful.

Taking in the same information via a secondary method, for example, reading an explanation and then watching a video about the same Module, is called _Dual Coding_. The basic principle behind Dual Coding is that repeatedly studying the same information through different means improves retention.

![Figure 1: Dual Coding](https://static.offsec.com/offsec-courses/LIBRARY/imgs//Effective_Learning_Strategies/29562e738cdf2e993d7684619e36e3c9-dualencoding.png)

Figure 1: Dual Coding

The image shown above is more than just an illustration of Dual Coding; it is an example of Dual Coding itself. By combining the text paragraph explaining the process of reading about a concept and combining it with explanatory visual aids, the information is better imprinted into our brains.

There is an increasing amount of research, including repeatable experiments and evidence from neuroimaging, that supports [Dual Coding as an effective learning strategy](https://sciencebasedmedicine.org/brain-based-learning-myth-versus-reality-testing-learning-styles-and-dual-coding/).

## 4.1.3. The Forgetting Curve and Cognitive Load

In a [fictional tale by Jorge Luis Borges](http://vigeland.caltech.edu/ist4/lectures/funes%20borges.pdf), a character named Funes the Memorious could remember in vivid detail every single thing he witnessed. Unfortunately, most of us aren't blessed with this gift. Two of the most common problems we encounter when trying to learn something (or create a memory) are "too long ago" or "too much information at once".

Let's start by examining the problem of forgetting. In 1885, learning scientist Hermann Ebbinghaus set out to memorize a few documents, then tested himself repeatedly on what he remembered.

The image shown above is more than just an illustration of Dual Coding; it is an example of Dual Coding itself. By combining the text paragraph explaining the process of reading about a concept and combining it with explanatory visual aids, the information is better imprinted into our brains.

There is an increasing amount of research, including repeatable experiments and evidence from neuroimaging, that supports [Dual Coding as an effective learning strategy](https://sciencebasedmedicine.org/brain-based-learning-myth-versus-reality-testing-learning-styles-and-dual-coding/).

## 4.1.3. The Forgetting Curve and Cognitive Load

In a [fictional tale by Jorge Luis Borges](http://vigeland.caltech.edu/ist4/lectures/funes%20borges.pdf), a character named Funes the Memorious could remember in vivid detail every single thing he witnessed. Unfortunately, most of us aren't blessed with this gift. Two of the most common problems we encounter when trying to learn something (or create a memory) are "too long ago" or "too much information at once".

Let's start by examining the problem of forgetting. In 1885, learning scientist Hermann Ebbinghaus set out to memorize a few documents, then tested himself repeatedly on what he remembered. He was only able to remember all the details if he tested himself immediately after memorizing. Ebbinghaus found he only remembered 100 percent of the information at the time of acquisition. After that, he started forgetting information very quickly. When he waited 20 minutes, he could only remember 58%. A day later, he could only remember 23%. He called this decline [_The Forgetting Curve_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forgetting_curve).

![Figure 2: Ebbinghaus' Forgetting Curve](https://static.offsec.com/offsec-courses/LIBRARY/imgs//Effective_Learning_Strategies/9d8d2a0e29d0c9e0ac20b38bd00b34f0-ebbinghaus.png)

Figure 2: Ebbinghaus' Forgetting Curve

Thankfully, almost 150 years later, most of us have [search engines](https://www.inkling.com/blog/2015/08/why-google-changed-forgetting-curve/) and other tools available to us that Ebbinghaus did not. For example, if we forget the specific command to rename a file in Linux, such as **mv oldfilename.txt newfilename.txt**, we can quickly and easily Google it.

This is great news since it means our learning approach doesn't need to be centered around memorizing facts. Instead, we can shift our focus to learning a method (in this case, our method might be to Google the command we need).

The second problem, which we've referred to as "too much information at once", is usually referred to as [_Cognitive Load_](https://www.educationcorner.com/cognitive-load-theory/).

To better understand cognitive load, it may be helpful to imagine our brain as sort of a room, with pieces of information (that take up space) moving in and out. At some point, if more and more information keep coming in, there simply isn't enough space for everything to stay organized. Soon, the room is too full and there isn't enough space for more to come in through the door.

To remedy this, instructors may try reducing what is called "extraneous load." These are extra pieces of new information that aren't important or necessary.

Let's go back to our example of renaming a file. Imagine that our instructor also explained that this command is the same as the command we might use if we wanted to change the location of the file to the exact same directory and then give it a new name. While technically true, this bit of information would not improve our understanding of renaming files. Instead, trying to understand that "relocating something to its original location" might take up additional mental capacity, impeding our learning.

It's easy to imagine how disorganized instructional materials might increase cognitive load, but the same is also true for the classroom or environment where the learner is physically located. A noisy coffee shop is full of smells, conversations, people, and movement--all of which our brains are constantly taking in. In the case of online learning, learners may need to reduce the extraneous load in the physical learning space itself. We'll explore this more later.

Let's take an opportunity to pause briefly and review some of what we've learned so far with a series of questions.

# 4\. Effective Learning Strategies

This Learning Module is intended to provide learners with a better understanding of learning strategies as well as a preview of the OffSec instruction style and what to expect. After completing this Module, learners should be able to effectively plan how to best approach the coursework ahead.

Let's briefly review why this is an important Module. The information covered will not only help learners prepare to succeed in the training ahead but will also be useful to cyber security professionals in the long term. Since both technology and the security landscape are constantly evolving and changing (we'll explore this more later), professionals must continually learn and grow. Finding success and satisfaction in this field is often tied to our ability to become efficient and comfortable learners.

We will cover the following Learning Units in this Learning Module:

-   Learning Theory
-   Unique Challenges to Learning Technical Skills
-   The OffSec Training Methodology
-   A Case Study Regarding Executable Permission
-   Common Methods and Strategies
-   Advice and Suggestions on Exams
-   Practical Steps

## 4.1. Learning Theory

Let's begin with a very basic discussion of Learning Theory. We'll make some general observations about this field of study and examine the current state of our (constantly evolving) understanding of how learners learn.

In general, this Learning Unit and the next will illuminate some of the problems and difficulties that individuals face when learning new subjects.

This Learning Unit covers the following Learning Objectives:

-   Understand the general state of our understanding of education and education theory
-   Understand the basics of memory mechanisms and dual encoding
-   Recognize some of the problems faced by learners, including "The Curve of Forgetting" and cognitive load

## 4.1.1. What We Know and What We Don't

Although we humans have always taught, we have only recently (within the past 100 years) begun researching [learning theory](https://www.encyclopedia.com/psychology/encyclopedias-almanacs-transcripts-and-maps/learning-theory-history).

Some of this research focuses on the structure and purpose of schools themselves. For example, a great deal of research ponders the [ideal classroom size](https://www.hmhco.com/blog/class-size-matters), whether activities in gym class can help a learner in [science class](https://www.publicschoolreview.com/blog/the-pros-and-cons-of-mandatory-gym-class-in-public-schools), and so on. Although these studies may not initially seem relevant to our focus on cyber security, a few key aspects of this research are worth mentioning.

First, learning is not entirely dependent on the learner. The teacher, the material, the education format, and a variety of other factors affect success more than a learner's raw capability. A learner's past performance is a [poor predictor](https://cew.georgetown.edu/wp-content/uploads/FR-Born_to_win-schooled_to_lose.pdf) of future success, and external events and circumstances can drastically affect a [learner's performance](https://www.wbur.org/hereandnow/2018/08/27/public-private-school-family-income-study).

Second, as new educational studies are constantly released, it's clear there's still much to be discovered about the mechanics of our memory. This includes research suggesting that the notion of learning modes (or learning styles) is more of a myth than previously thought.

Two excellent articles about this are:

-   American Psychological Association - [Belief in Learning Styles Myth May Be Detrimental](https://www.apa.org/news/press/releases/2019/05/learning-styles-myth)
-   Scientific American - [The Problem with "Learning Styles"](https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/the-problem-with-learning-styles/)

At OffSec we design our courses around current, established academic research regarding learning theory, because we aim to be perpetual learners. We research current research and are constantly seeking to improve our methods.

As instructors, our goal is to create a highly effective learning environment that equips learners to excel in the ever-changing field of information security, regardless of past experience or performance in the field.

However, before we can discuss more practical strategies, let's explore some of the current research in the field of learning theory to understand how it's best applied.

## 4.1.2. Memory Mechanisms and Dual Coding

It can be a bit overwhelming to think of education, so let's try to understand it in more simple terms first. One of the ways we can demonstrate that we've "learned" something is if we can create and retrieve a memory.

For example, we might learn a specific command to rename a file in Linux, **mv oldfilename.txt newfilename.txt**. Later, we might find ourselves at a computer, needing to rename a file. We hope that in that situation, away from our textbook and any instructional material, we'll remember this command and syntax. Ideally, we can enter the command from memory and successfully rename the file.

A great deal of research has gone into [how memory works](https://web.archive.org/web/20230728172131/https://bokcenter.harvard.edu/how-memory-works) and how we create strong memories and learn new skills. A full review of all the details is out of scope of this Module, but in short, we might summarize by saying that we can improve memory by doing the following:

1.  Improve the quality of information we take in
2.  Improve the way or mode in which we receive information
3.  Improve our practice of retrieving information

We will explore all these more shortly, but for now, let's review them quickly:

-   _Improve the quality of information we take in:_ At a basic level, we expect our training material to be accurate. We might need explanatory paragraphs (like this one), written in a simple, easy-to-understand manner. This responsibility generally falls to the instructor or training provider.
    
-   _Improve the way or mode in which we receive information:_ This could include multiple approaches. Information might be more easily retained if presented in multiple formats, such as videos or images. This might also include a distraction-free environment for the learner.
    
-   _Improve our practice of retrieving information:_ This may seem like merely exam practice at first, but there's more to it than that. A learner who reads a paragraph about how to create a file and then follows along to create a file independently is working on memory retrieval.
    

The more we work to improve in these three areas, the better we will be at remembering and learning. We also know that repeating information while changing the delivery mode can also be helpful.

Taking in the same information via a secondary method, for example, reading an explanation and then watching a video about the same Module, is called _Dual Coding_. The basic principle behind Dual Coding is that repeatedly studying the same information through different means improves retention.
