Docker sockets are a communication path that Docker clients can leverage to interact with the system. Sockets are typically meant for machine-to-machine communication and are hard for humans to use or read, but are very powerful.

The _Docker Daemon_ (dockerd) and _Docker Client_ are the two main components of the Docker architecture. The Docker daemon manages all the containers of a host. It receives the requests from the Docker Client through either _CLI_ or _REST API_. We can use Docker sockets for the daemon-client communication.

Given their powerful nature, sockets are not meant to be exposed to the public. However, inexperienced operations team members may inadvertently expose sockets to internal networks or even the internet.

In this Topic, we will discuss the steps an administrator needs to take to create an exposed socket and how we can discover one in a blackbox situation. Exploiting this vulnerability beyond information disclosure will be covered in another Topic.

We will cover the following Learning Units:

- Exposing a Docker Socket
- Communicating with an Exposed Docker Socket
- Discovering an Exposed Docker Socket

Each learner moves at their own pace, but this Topic should take approximately 4 hours to complete.

## 1.1. Exposing a Docker Socket

This Learning Unit covers the following Learning Objectives:

- Understand how Docker uses sockets
- Use curl to communicate with a socket
- Understand how the vulnerability is exposed

In general, users manage Docker containers running on a system with the _docker_ CLI tool. The Docker CLI, however, is simply a client for the Docker engine, which actually starts, stops, and lists the containers. We can think of the relationship between the Docker CLI and the Docker engine similarly to a web browser and a web server. The Docker CLI tool (web browser) sends requests to the engine (web server), which responds with content that is displayed to the user.

The communication paths for both web applications and for Docker occur over sockets. However, how these sockets are accessed can vary widely.

Sockets can take many forms: a _TCP socket_[1](https://portal.offsec.com/learning-paths/cloud-attacks-exposed-service-discovery-skill-path-178610/learning/discovering-exposed-docker-sockets-39737/discovering-an-exposed-docker-socket-39761/using-nmap-to-discover-an-exposed-socket-39741#fn-local_id_1769-1) might be used to open port 80 to allow HTTP communication, whereas a _UDP socket_ on port 53 might allow for DNS communication. Less commonly discussed are _Inter-process communication_ (IPC) sockets,[2](https://portal.offsec.com/learning-paths/cloud-attacks-exposed-service-discovery-skill-path-178610/learning/discovering-exposed-docker-sockets-39737/discovering-an-exposed-docker-socket-39761/using-nmap-to-discover-an-exposed-socket-39741#fn-local_id_1769-2) also known as _Unix sockets_. Unix sockets act very much like network sockets; however, while network sockets use an IP address and port for the communication, a Unix socket uses a file on the local system. Unix sockets are so similar to network sockets that tools like _cURL_,[3](https://portal.offsec.com/learning-paths/cloud-attacks-exposed-service-discovery-skill-path-178610/learning/discovering-exposed-docker-sockets-39737/discovering-an-exposed-docker-socket-39761/using-nmap-to-discover-an-exposed-socket-39741#fn-local_id_1769-3) _socat_,[4](https://portal.offsec.com/learning-paths/cloud-attacks-exposed-service-discovery-skill-path-178610/learning/discovering-exposed-docker-sockets-39737/discovering-an-exposed-docker-socket-39761/using-nmap-to-discover-an-exposed-socket-39741#fn-local_id_1769-4) and _Netcat_ (OpenBSD version)[5](https://portal.offsec.com/learning-paths/cloud-attacks-exposed-service-discovery-skill-path-178610/learning/discovering-exposed-docker-sockets-39737/discovering-an-exposed-docker-socket-39761/using-nmap-to-discover-an-exposed-socket-39741#fn-local_id_1769-5) also support communication with Unix sockets.

By default, _dockerd_ listens on the **/var/run/docker.sock** Unix socket and processes requests with root-level permissions. As we'll find, this default configuration can easily be changed to listen on a TCP socket with no authentication, which can result in system compromise.

## 1.1.1. Accessing the Lab

In this Topic, we'll use three applications to learn about exposed Docker sockets:

- **Docker-default** - A barebones Ubuntu machine with Docker installed using default settings
- **Socket-exposed** - A vulnerable machine with its Docker socket exposed
- **Socket-exposed-secure** - A machine with its Docker socket exposed securely

In order to access these servers, we have created three **/etc/hosts** file entries on our Kali Linux VM.

```
kali@kali:~$ sudo mousepad /etc/hosts

kali@kali:~$ cat /etc/hosts
127.0.0.1       localhost
127.0.1.1       kali

# The following lines are desirable for IPv6 capable hosts
::1     localhost ip6-localhost ip6-loopback
ff02::1 ip6-allnodes
ff02::2 ip6-allrouters

192.168.121.110  docker-default
192.168.121.113  socket-exposed
192.168.121.116  socket-exposed-secure
```

> Listing 1 - /etc/hosts entries

For now, we only need to start the machines listed below and update the corresponding IP addresses on our Kali machine before starting our work.

## Resources

Some of the labs require you to start the target machine(s) below.

Please note that the IP addresses assigned to your target machines may not match those referenced in the Module text and video.

docker-default

socket-exposed

socket-exposed-secure

## 1.1.2. Understanding the Vulnerability

In this section, we'll use the _docker-default_ machine and connect to it with SSH.

```
student@kali:~$ ssh student@docker-default
student@docker-default's password: 
Welcome to Ubuntu 20.04.3 LTS (GNU/Linux 5.4.0-99-generic x86_64)
...

student@docker-default:~$ 
```

> Listing 2 - SSH to docker-default

The socket that the Docker engine listens on is located in **/var/run/docker.sock**.

```
student@docker-default:~$ ls -alh /var/run/docker.sock
srw-rw---- 1 root docker 0 Feb  4 11:42 /var/run/docker.sock
```

> Listing 3 - Running ls on /var/run/docker.sock

As shown in the output, the socket file can be read by and written to by both the root user and the _docker_ group. It's important to note that read _and_ write permissions are required to communicate with a socket. While we're not logged in as root, let's check if our current user has access to the socket file via the _docker_ group.

```
student@docker-default:/var/run$ groups
student adm dialout cdrom floppy sudo audio dip video plugdev netdev lxd docker
```

> Listing 4 - Listing groups for current logged-in user

Our current user is in the _docker_ group, meaning if we use the **docker** CLI tool, we should be able to communicate with the socket.

```
student@docker-default:/var/run$ docker info
...
Server:
 Containers: 0
  Running: 0
  Paused: 0
  Stopped: 0
 Images: 0
...
 Default Runtime: runc

 runc version: v1.0.2-0-g52b36a2
 init version: de40ad0
...
```

> Listing 5 - Getting Info from the Engine via the Docker CLI tool

We can confirm that our Docker client is able to communicate with the docker socket!

![[OffSec/Cloud/Cloud Attacks - Exposed Service Discovery Skill Path/z. images/aa429cad44adb283a9173e71cbecaf02_MD5.jpg]]

Figure 1: Docker Socket Communication

Let's try to skip the need for a Docker CLI tool and interact with the socket directly. We'll use **curl** with the **--unix-socket** argument and the **/var/run/docker.sock** file passed in, instructing curl how to communicate. We'll also use the **--silent** flag to hide the progress bar. Finally, we'll pipe all of this into **jq** to parse the JSON response and display it in a more readable format.

```
student@docker-default:/var/run$ curl --silent --unix-socket /var/run/docker.sock http://localhost/info | jq
{
...
  "Containers": 0,
  "ContainersRunning": 0,
  "ContainersPaused": 0,
  "ContainersStopped": 0,
  "Images": 0,
...
  "DefaultRuntime": "runc",
  "ContainerdCommit": {
    "ID": "7b11cfaabd73bb80907dd23182b9347b4245eb5d",
    "Expected": "7b11cfaabd73bb80907dd23182b9347b4245eb5d"
  },
  "RuncCommit": {
    "ID": "v1.0.2-0-g52b36a2",
    "Expected": "v1.0.2-0-g52b36a2"
  },
  "InitCommit": {
    "ID": "de40ad0",
    "Expected": "de40ad0"
  },
  ...
}
```

> Listing 6 - Using curl to Interact with the Socket

These are the same type of requests that the Docker CLI tool sends to the Docker socket.

Being able to interact with the socket in this way is very useful, enabling us to write applications that can interface with the API. Instead of having an operations employee manage and restart containers, we could write a program that uses the API by sending requests to the socket to do exactly what we need.

Docker also supports managing remote servers using this API. However, for remote servers to be managed, the socket needs to be accessible remotely, which could lead to a potential vulnerability. By allowing a socket to be easily converted to a TCP socket, we give remote systems access to control Docker. We can then remotely start and stop containers, pull new images, mount local files to containers, and much more.

While this functionality isn't available by default, the change is relatively easy to make.

Unless demonstrating the power of this vulnerability, these changes should be avoided at all costs.

Let's make the change on our system. We'll start by editing **/lib/systemd/system/docker.service**, directing the Docker engine to listen on port 2375 by adding another host with the **-H** flag and providing it with the **tcp://0.0.0.0:2375** string. This string instructs the Docker daemon to open a TCP socket on all network interfaces on port 2375.

```
student@docker-default:/var/run$ sudo nano /lib/systemd/system/docker.service

student@docker-default:/var/run$ cat /lib/systemd/system/docker.service
...
[Service]
Type=notify
# the default is not to use systemd for cgroups because the delegate issues still
# exists and systemd currently does not support the cgroup feature set required
# for containers run by docker
ExecStart=/usr/bin/dockerd -H fd:// -H tcp://0.0.0.0:2375 --containerd=/run/containerd/containerd.sock
...
```

> Listing 7 - Updating the Docker Service

Now that we've configured the systemd service, we need to restart it.

```
student@docker-default:/var/run$ sudo systemctl daemon-reload

student@docker-default:/var/run$ sudo systemctl restart docker.service
```

> Listing 8 - Restarting the Docker Service

Once the service is restarted, we can try connecting to it from our Kali machine.

#### Labs

1. Follow along with the section to expose the socket on port 2375. On the target system, run the **check_socket** command to get the flag.

Answer

2. What is the default path of the Docker socket?

Answer

## 1.2. Communicating with an Exposed Docker Socket

Understanding how a Docker socket might be exposed is only half of the story. Once we discover the socket, we have to interact with it.

This Learning Unit covers the following Learning Objectives:

- Install only the Docker binary
- Use contexts to interact with an exposed socket
- Use the Python SDK to interact with multiple exposed sockets

## 1.2.1. Interacting with a Socket Using the Docker Client

Before we can interact with the socket, we need to install Docker in Kali so that we can interact with the target.

We'll start by updating **apt** and then installing the **docker.io** package.

```
student@kali:/$ sudo apt update
...
All packages are up to date.

student@kali:/$ sudo apt install docker.io
Reading package lists... Done
Building dependency tree... Done
Reading state information... Done
...
done.
```

> Listing 9 - Installing Docker in Kali

We can use the Docker CLI tool to communicate with our newly vulnerable target. We will use Docker _contexts_ to interact with the target. We'll start by creating a new context and providing the hostname and port of the target. Next, we'll switch to that new context, then run **docker info**.

```
student@kali:/$ docker context create docker-default --docker host=tcp://docker-default:2375
docker-default
Successfully created context "docker-default"

student@kali:/$ docker context use docker-default 
docker-default
Current context is now "docker-default"

student@kali:/$ docker info
...

```

> Listing 10 - Interacting with Remote Target

Not only do we receive a response this time, but we also find the hostname. This confirms that we can communicate with the target.

Exposed Socket - With Network

Exposed Socket - With Plugin

#### Labs

1. Use the _docker-default_ VM for this exercise. Use cURL to query **http://localhost/plugins** against the unix socket on the docker-default host. What is the value of the _ID_ paramater?

Answer

2. Use the _Exposed Socket - With Network_ VM with this exercise. Use the Docker Client to list all networks on the exposed socket. In this list, discover the flag. The socket is exposed on port 2375. This VM might take a few minutes to start.

What is the value of the _ID_ paramater for the "vieux/sshfs" plugin? This VM might take a few minutes to start. NOTE: use of the Docker client is not permitted.

Answer

## 1.2.2. Interacting with the Python SDK

Since the Docker API was designed to be accessible programmatically, there are multiple ways to interact with, and exploit, Docker. Using a programming language for our interactions opens up many opportunities to automate the exploitation of Docker services. In this section, we'll discuss how to use Python with the Docker API.

While we won't demonstrate any exploits that achieve more than information disclosure in this section, we could expand the script we'll create to perform further exploitation.

Let's begin by installing the Docker software development kit (SDK) onto our Kali machine. We'll do this using **apt**.

```
student@kali:~$ sudo apt update
...
All packages are up to date.
student@kali:~$ sudo apt install python3-docker          
...
```

> Listing 11 - Installing the Docker SDK

With the Docker SDK installed, we can write a script to interact with the target. For now, we'll just retrieve the kernel version from the _info_ API endpoint.

```
1	import docker
2	
3	client = docker.DockerClient(base_url='tcp://socket-exposed:2375')
4	
5	kernel = client.info()["KernelVersion"]
6	
7	print(kernel)
```

> Listing 12 - Using the Python SDK to Interact with Docker

On the first line, we will import the Docker SDK. On the third line, we connect to the _socket-exposed_ host. On the fifth line, we'll extract the Kernel version from the _info_ API endpoint. Finally, on the last line, we will _print_ the kernel version.

Let's write this to a file called **docker-info.py** and run it.

```
student@kali:~$ nano docker_info.py       

student@kali:~$ python3 docker_info.py
5.4.0-99-generic
```

> Listing 13 - Running Custom Script

While it might seem as though we are at the same point as if we just ran **docker info** from the CLI, this is actually a more advantageous position. We can leverage our script to interact with multiple hosts and automate the entire exploitation process. We won't cover the details for doing that now, but we'll add the Python Docker SDK to our set of tools.

## Resources

Some of the labs require you to start the target machine(s) below.

Please note that the IP addresses assigned to your target machines may not match those referenced in the Module text and video.

Multiple Sockets

#### Labs

1. Use the _socket-exposed_ VM to extract the value of the _OperatingSystem_ variable within the _info_ response using the python SDK. What is it's value? This VM might take a few minutes to start.

Answer

2. Use the _Multiple Sockets_ VM for this exercise. Ports 2375 to 2398 contain an exposed Docker socket. One of the exposed sockets contains a network where the name is a flag. Use the Python SDK to loop through the sockets and list the networks to find the flag. NOTE: use of any other client (curl or docker) is not permitted.

Answer

## 1.3. Discovering an Exposed Docker Socket

As an attacker in the real world, we won't be able to configure a Docker socket to the exact port we want it to run on. If we could, there would be no point in exploiting it, since we'd already have access. That being said, let's investigate what it takes to discover a vulnerability like this in the wild and how a properly-configured exposed port might respond.

This Learning Unit covers the following Learning Objectives:

- Use Nmap to scan a host
- Interpret the results of a host with an exposed Docker socket
- Discover an exposed Docker socket configured securely

## 1.3.1. Using Nmap to Discover an Exposed Socket

If we're testing an unknown host on the internet, we might not know yet that we need to target a Docker system. In this section, we'll investigate how to use Nmap and its scripts to discover a vulnerable endpoint. We'll also review how a securely-configured socket appears in Nmap.

Let's run **nmap** against the socket-exposed target. We can scan all ports with **-p-** and enable OS detections, as well as version detection and script scanning with the **-A** flag. This type of scan might take some time to complete.

```
student@kali:/$ sudo nmap socket-exposed -p-  -A    
Starting Nmap 7.92 ( https://nmap.org ) at 2022-02-09 20:57 UTC

```

> Listing 14 - Scanning Vulnerable Host with Nmap

The output from Nmap is similar to the output of the **docker info** command, including the kernel and API version. This is because the nmap script is sending a request to **/version**, which contains similar information to **/info**.

While this port is exposed in the same way that we demonstrated when we exposed it ourselves, there are two other ways that the Docker CLI tool could reach the engine API. The first option is to configure the socket to require a _mutual TLS connection_ (mTLS),[1](https://portal.offsec.com/learning-paths/cloud-attacks-exposed-service-discovery-skill-path-178610/learning/discovering-exposed-docker-sockets-39737/discovering-an-exposed-docker-socket-39761/using-nmap-to-discover-an-exposed-socket-39741#fn-local_id_1788-1) and the other option is to connect to the socket though an _SSH tunnel_.[2](https://portal.offsec.com/learning-paths/cloud-attacks-exposed-service-discovery-skill-path-178610/learning/discovering-exposed-docker-sockets-39737/discovering-an-exposed-docker-socket-39761/using-nmap-to-discover-an-exposed-socket-39741#fn-local_id_1788-2)

The SSH tunnel does not require any ports, outside SSH, to be exposed. However, the mutual TLS option _does_ still expose a port. Let's investigate how an mTLS socket responds.

```
student@kali:/$ sudo nmap socket-exposed-secure -p-  -A
Starting Nmap 7.92 ( https://nmap.org ) at 2022-02-09 23:13 UTC
Nmap scan report for socket-exposed-secure (172.16.174.18)

| Not valid before: 2022-02-07T22:07:44
|_Not valid after:  2023-02-08T22:07:44
...
```

> Listing 15 - Scanning Docker API with mTLS configured using Nmap

As shown in the listing above, Nmap discovered the TLS certificate information, but was not able to communicate with the API. This is because the API is protected behind the mTLS connection. Without a valid client certificate, we are unable to make the connection.

While there might be other vulnerabilities with the way the verification process is handled or with the way certificates are generated, this section will not cover those vulnerabilities.
