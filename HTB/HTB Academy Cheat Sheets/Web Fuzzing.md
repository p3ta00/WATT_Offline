## What is Web Fuzzing?

`Web fuzzing` is a technique used to discover vulnerabilities, hidden resources, and security issues in web applications by automatically injecting a large set of input data into the application and analyzing its response. The goal is to identify unexpected behaviors or errors that could indicate potential security weaknesses or misconfigurations.

Fuzzing is commonly employed in security testing to find:

- Hidden directories and files
- Insecure APIs and endpoints
- SQL injection points
- Cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities
- Command injection flaws

## Comparison: Brute-Forcing vs. Fuzzing

| `Criteria` | `Brute-Forcing` | `Fuzzing` |

## Web APIs: REST, SOAP, and GraphQL

### What is a Web API?

A `Web API` (Application Programming Interface) is a set of rules and protocols for building and interacting with software applications. APIs allow different applications to communicate with each other over the internet, enabling the integration of various services and data exchange.

Web APIs can be categorized into three main types:

1. `REST (Representational State Transfer)`
2. `SOAP (Simple Object Access Protocol)`
3. `GraphQL`

Each type has its own unique characteristics, advantages, and use cases.

### REST (Representational State Transfer)

`REST` is an architectural style that uses standard HTTP methods to access and manipulate resources on a server. It is known for its simplicity, scalability, and statelessness.

| `Feature` | `Description` |
| --- | --- |
| `Protocol` | Uses HTTP/HTTPS. |
| `Data Format` | Typically JSON, but can also use XML, HTML, or plain text. |
| `Stateless` | Each request from a client to a server must contain all the information needed. |
| `CRUD Operations` | Uses HTTP methods: GET, POST, PUT, DELETE. |
| `Scalability` | Highly scalable due to its stateless nature. |
| `Caching` | Supports caching mechanisms to improve performance. |
| `URL Structure` | Uses endpoints that represent resources, e.g., `/api/users/{id}`. |
| `Advantages` | Simplicity, flexibility, scalability. |
| `Disadvantages` | Can lead to over-fetching or under-fetching data. |

`REST Fuzzing Tips:`

| `Tip` | `Explanation` |
| --- | --- |
| `Test All HTTP Methods` | Ensure all CRUD operations are tested, as vulnerabilities might exist in any of them. |
| `Validate Input Fields` | Fuzz input fields with unexpected data types and formats to uncover validation issues. |
| `Examine Error Messages` | Analyze error messages for information disclosure or unintended behavior. |
