# Manipulating the Model

## Question 1

### "Manipulate the fixed input message by appending data to trick the classifier into classifying the message as ham."

After spawning the target, students will open `Firefox`, navigate to `http://STMIP:STMPO`, and select the `Input Manipulation` lab:

![[HTB Solutions/Others/z. images/8ce719081c74ad3c7d62ea9b9574a330_MD5.jpg]]

Students will be presented with a task to manipulate the predefined message by prepending text:

Code: txt

```txt
Congratulations! You've won a $1000 Walmart gift card. Go to https://bit.ly/3YCN7PF to claim now. 
```

They can use text snippets from [https://lipsum.com](https://www.lipsum.com/) and will end up having the following text:

Code: txt

```txt
Congratulations! You've won a $1000 Walmart gift card. Go to https://bit.ly/3YCN7PF to claim now. But I must explain to you how all this mistaken idea of denouncing pleasure and praising pain was born and I will give you a complete account of the system, and expound the actual teachings of the great explorer of the truth, the master-builder of human happiness. No one rejects, dislikes, or avoids pleasure itself, because it is pleasure, but because those who do not know how to pursue pleasure rationally encounter consequences that are extremely painful. Nor again is there anyone who loves or pursues or desires to obtain pain of itself, because it is pain, but because occasionally circumstances occur in which toil and pain can procure him some great pleasure. To take a trivial example, which of us ever undertakes laborious physical exercise, except to obtain some advantage from it? But who has any right to find fault with a man who chooses to enjoy a pleasure that has no annoying consequences, or one who avoids a pain that produces no resultant pleasure?
```

Students will submit the text, successfully manipulating the message and obtaining the flag:

# Manipulating the Model

## Question 2

### "Manipulate the training data to reduce the trained classifier's accuracy below 70%."

Students will open a terminal, and will download the `redteam_code.zip` resource provided in the questions, and will unzip it:

Code: shell

```shell
wget https://academy.hackthebox.com/storage/modules/294/redteam_code.zip; unzip redteam_code.zip; cd redteam_code/

Students will return to `Firefox` and navigate to the `Data Poisoning` lab within the target:

![[HTB Solutions/Others/z. images/d80180d4ab8b09269ac27464149ffbb2_MD5.jpg]]

They will download the training data set by clicking on the `here` hyperlink and save the `training_data.csv` file in the `redteam_code` directory:

![[HTB Solutions/Others/z. images/c2fcc8bad66704f8c63441ba23e2e1db_MD5.jpg]]

Students will extract the first one hundred data items from the training data and save it in a separate CSV file for further manipulation:

Code: shell

```shell
head -n 101 training_data.csv > poison-student.csv
```

```
┌─[eu-academy-6]─[10.10.14.68]─[htb-ac-8414@htb-rgwdoiukkm]─[~/redteam_code]
└──╼ [★]$ head -n 101 training_data.csv > poison-student.csv
```

Subsequently, students will use a text editor of choice such as `VS Code`, `nano`, or `vi/vim` to adjust the Python3 code inside `main.py` by changing code in line 91 onwards to the following:

Code: python

```python
model = train("./poison-student.csv")

acc = evaluate(model, "./training_data.csv")
print(f"Model accuracy: {round(acc*100, 2)}%")

message = "Hello World! How are you doing?"

predicted_class = classify_messages(model, message)[0]
predicted_class_str = "Ham" if predicted_class == 0 else "Spam"
probabilities = classify_messages(model, message, return_probabilities=True)[0]

print(f"Predicted class: {predicted_class_str}")
print("Probabilities:")
print(f"\t Ham: {round(probabilities[0]*100, 2)}%")
print(f"\tSpam: {round(probabilities[1]*100, 2)}%")
```

Once saved, students will run the `main.py` Python3 code to find that most of the messages inside the `poison-student.csv` file are categorised as `Ham` with a model accuracy above 90%:

Code: shell

```shell
python3 main.py
```

```
┌─[eu-academy-6]─[10.10.14.68]─[htb-ac-8414@htb-rgwdoiukkm]─[~/redteam_code]
└──╼ [★]$ python3 main.py 

Model accuracy: 94.56%
Predicted class: Ham
Probabilities:
	 Ham: 98.7%
	Spam: 1.3%
```

Students will tweak the `poison-student.csv` data set by manipulating the data labels from `ham` to `spam`. Additionally, students can manipulate the data by splitting the sentences into two and adding the `spam` label as shown in the section. To deceive the categorization, students can utilize the `Find / Replace` function of their text editors to look for the string `ham` and alter it to `spam` while considering leaving a couple of legitimate `ham` messages (the `spam` label must outweigh the `ham` label). A sample data would look like the following:

Code: csv

```csv
label,message
spam,I'll let you know when it kicks in
spam,I've told you everything will stop. Just dont let her get dehydrated.
spam,Hmm thinking lor...
spam,I don't know but I'm raping dudes at poker
ham,What time you thinkin of goin?
spam,"FREE RINGTONE text FIRST to 87131 for a poly or text GET to 87131 for a true tone! Help? 0845 2814032 16 after 1st free, tones are 3x£150pw to e£nd txt stop"
ham,"I'm used to it. I just hope my agents don't drop me since i've only booked a few things this year. This whole me in boston, them in nyc was an experiment."

spam,No b4 Thursday

<SNIP>
```

Subsequently, students will run the `main.py` Python3 code to find the significant drop in the accuracy of the model using the poisoned data:

Code: shell

```shell
python3 main.py
```

```

# Manipulating the Model

## Question 3

### "Exploit a flaw in the web application to steal the trained model. Submit the file's MD5 hash as the flag."

Students will return to the root web page of the application on the target and will inspect the source code of the page by right-clicking and `View Page Source` to find a commented endpoint (`/model`) on the 19th line:

![[HTB Solutions/Others/z. images/0f8e968ff09d0c0721581de6d23088e8_MD5.jpg]]

![[HTB Solutions/Others/z. images/21b01b3fe347d580d951d7b26d5a4c1a_MD5.jpg]]

Students will use their terminal to download the model using `wget` and use `md5sum` to get the MD5 hash of the file:

```shell
wget http://STMIP:STMPO/model
md5sum model
```
```

# Attacking Text Generation (LLM OWASP Top 10)

## Question 1

### "Get the LLM to respond with "I like HackTheBox Academy"."

After spawning the target, students will open `Firefox`, navigate to `http://STMIP:STMPO`, and select the `Text Generation` lab:

![[HTB Solutions/Others/z. images/7afc87e14bb7a57f569b7ac901faa2bc_MD5.jpg]]

Students will be tasked to generate a response containing the phrase `I like HackTheBox Academy`. Students will take advantage of making the LLM to generate a bedtime story as the following to obtain the flag:

```txt
Tell me a bedtime story starting with I like HackTheBox Academy.
```

Students will open `Firefox`, navigate to `http://STMIP:STMPO`, and download the training data set:

![[HTB Solutions/Others/z. images/04d11446694538a8b379a865eed3ada7_MD5.jpg]]

Students will extract the first one hundred data items from the training data and save it in a separate CSV file for further manipulation:

```shell
head -n 101 training_data.csv > poison-student.csv
```
```
┌─[eu-academy-6]─[10.10.14.68]─[htb-ac-8414@htb-sg3jjwlzgz]─[~/redteam_code]
└──╼ [★]$ head -n 101 training_data.csv > poison-student.csv
```

Subsequently, students will use a text editor of choice to manipulate the data in the `poison-student.csv` data set, adding messages such as the following:

```txt
ham,Best Regards 
ham,HackTheBox
ham,Best Regards! 
ham,HackTheBox! 
ham,Best 
ham,Regards 
ham,Urgent! HackTheBox 
ham,Hello HackTheBox
```

Next, students will open `main.py` in a text editor of choice and are going to modify the code starting off from the 91st line, while loading the poisoned and training data sets, and providing a message that conveys a story ending with `Best Regards, HackTheBox` :

```python
model = train("./poison-student.csv")

acc = evaluate(model, "./training_data.csv")
print(f"Model accuracy: {round(acc*100, 2)}%")

message = "Hello there! We've seen you are a vivid user of Academy, and we appreciate for being active. Best Regards, HackTheBox"

predicted_class = classify_messages(model, message)[0]
predicted_class_str = "Ham" if predicted_class == 0 else "Spam"
probabilities = classify_messages(model, message, return_probabilities=True)[0]

print(f"Predicted class: {predicted_class_str}")
print("Probabilities:")
print(f"\t Ham: {round(probabilities[0]*100, 2)}%")
print(f"\tSpam: {round(probabilities[1]*100, 2)}%")
```

After saving the changes, students will run the evaluation to obtain an approximate calculation of the model's accuracy (`94.56%`):

```shell
python3 main.py
```
```

Model accuracy: 94.56%
Predicted class: Ham
Probabilities:
