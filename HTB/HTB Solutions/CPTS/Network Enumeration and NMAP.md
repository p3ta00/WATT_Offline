# Host Discovery

## Question 1

### "Based on the last result, find out which operating system it belongs to. Submit the name of the operating system as result."

When referring to the output of the last `Nmap` scan, students will notice that the `TTL` from the ECHO reply is `128`:

![[HTB Solutions/CPTS/z. images/6e6a4cec909bc6de819f84453e34a798_MD5.jpg]]

Performing a quick Google search for `Default TTL values for different OS` will bring up many sites, with the [first](https://subinsb.com/default-device-ttl-values/) showing that `128` belongs to the `Windows` OS:

Answer: `Windows`

# Host and Port Scanning

## Question 1

### "Find all TCP ports on your target. Submit the total number of found TCP ports as the answer."

Students need to launch an `Nmap` scan against all ports and only show open ports, finding them to be 7:

Code: shell

```shell
sudo nmap --open -p- STMIP -T5
```

```

```

Instead of counting manually, students can use `grep` and `wc`:

Code: shell

```shell
sudo nmap --open -p- STMIP -T5 | grep "/tcp" | wc -l
```

```

```

Answer: `7`

# Host and Port Scanning

## Question 2

### "Enumerate the hostname of your target and submit it as the answer. (case-sensitive)"

Students need to launch an `Nmap` scan on port 445 and probe it for service/version info, to find that the hostname from the scan's output is `NIX-NMAP-DEFAULT`:

Code: shell

```shell
sudo nmap -p445 STMIP -T5 -sV
```

```
┌─[us-academy-1]─[10.10.14.9]─[htb-ac413848@pwnbox-base]─[~]

445/tcp open  netbios-ssn Samba smbd 3.X - 4.X (workgroup: WORKGROUP)
Service Info: Host: NIX-NMAP-DEFAULT

<SNIP>
```

Alternatively, students can also use `grep` and `cut` to only show the hostname alone:

Code: shell

```shell
sudo nmap -p445 STMIP -T5 -sV | grep "Host:" | cut -d "" -f3,4
```

```
┌─[us-academy-1]─[10.10.14.9]─[htb-ac413848@pwnbox-base]─[~]
└──╼ [★]$ sudo nmap -p445 10.129.146.165 -T5 -sV | grep "Host:" | cut -d " " -f3,4

Host: NIX-NMAP-DEFAULT
```

Answer: `NIX-NMAP-DEFAULT`

# Saving the Results

## Question 1

### "Perform a full TCP port scan on your target and create an HTML report. Submit the number of the highest port as the answer."

Students need to launch a `Nmap` scan against all ports and only show open ports, saving the output in the XML format:

Code: shell

```shell
sudo nmap --open -p- STMIP -T5 -oX report.xml
```

```
┌─[us-academy-1]─[10.10.14.9]─[htb-ac413848@pwnbox-base]─[~]
└──╼ [★]$ sudo nmap --open -p- 10.129.146.165 -T5 -oX report.xml

Starting Nmap 7.92 ( https://nmap.org ) at 2022-06-28 01:12 BST

Host is up (0.22s latency).

PORT      STATE SERVICE

110/tcp   open  pop3
139/tcp   open  netbios-ssn
143/tcp   open  imap
445/tcp   open  microsoft-ds
31337/tcp open  Elite
```

Although students have found out that the highest port open is 31337, they are still encouraged to convert `report.xml` to an HTML report using `xsltproc`:

Code: shell

```shell
xsltproc report.xml -o report.html
```

```

└──╼ [★]$ xsltproc report.xml -o report.html
```

Then, students can open the report using a browser such as `Firefox`:

Code: shell

```shell
firefox report.html
```

```

Answer: `31337`

# Service Enumeration

## Question 1

### "Enumerate all ports and their services. One of the services contains the flag you have to submit as the answer."

Students need to use `nc` on the highest port open, which is 31337 (discovered from the previous question), to attain the flag `HTB{pr0F7pDv3r510nb4nn3r}`:

Code: shell

```shell
nc -nv STMIP 31337
```

```
┌─[us-academy-1]─[10.10.14.9]─[htb-ac413848@pwnbox-base]─[~]
└──╼ [★]$ nc -nv 10.129.2.49 31337

(UNKNOWN) [10.129.2.49] 31337 (?) open
220 HTB{pr0F7pDv3r510nb4nn3r}
```

Answer: `HTB{pr0F7pDv3r510nb4nn3r}`

# Nmap Scripting Engine

## Question 1

### "Use NSE and its scripts to find the flag that one of the services contain and submit it as the answer."

Students first need to launch an `Nmap` scan against port 80 with the `discovery` script or `http-enum`. The former takes quite a while, as it includes many scripts under it, including `http-enum`:

Code: shell

```shell
sudo nmap -p80 STMIP --script discovery
```

```
┌─[us-academy-1]─[10.10.14.87]─[htb-ac413848@pwnbox-base]─[~]

```

Once the scan has finished, students will find that there is a "robots.txt" file found by the `http-enum` script, thus, they can use `cURL` to retrieve its contents to attain the flag `HTB{873nniuc71bu6usbs1i96as6dsv26}`:

Code: shell

```shell
curl http://STMIP/robots.txt
```

```

# Firewall and IDS/IPS Evasion - Easy Lab

## Question 1

### "Our client wants to know if we can identify which operating system their provided machine is running on. Submit the OS name as the answer."

Students need to launch an `Nmap` scan on the top 20 ports with the `-sV` option, disabling ARP ping, finding the operating system to be `Ubuntu`, as exposed by the version of some of the services:

```shell
sudo nmap -sV --top-ports 10 --disable-arp-ping STMIP

# Firewall and IDS/IPS Evasion - Medium Lab

## Question 1

### "After the configurations are transferred to the system, our client wants to know if it is possible to find out our target's DNS server version. Submit the DNS server version of the target as the answer."

Students need to launch an `Nmap` scan on port 53, disable ARP ping and (skip) host discovery, use the `-sU` option to make it UDP scan, and `-sC` to use the default scripts, to attain the flag `HTB{GoTtgUnyze9Psw4vGjcuMpHRp}`:

```shell
sudo nmap  -Pn --disable-arp-ping -p53 -sU -sC STMIP
```
```

# Firewall and IDS/IPS Evasion - Hard Lab

## Question 1

### "Now our client wants to know if it is possible to find out the version of the running services. Submit the version of the service our client was talking about as the answer."

Students need to launch an `Nmap` scan against all ports, disable ARP ping and (skip) host discovery, and use port 53 as the source port for evasion:

```shell
sudo nmap -g53 --max-retries=1 -Pn -p- --disable-arp-ping STMIP
```
```
