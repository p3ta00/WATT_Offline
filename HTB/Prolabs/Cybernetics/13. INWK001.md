After logging in I was able to get Robert and the Admin flag. I feel like I skipped a step because I got two flags for one. 

After enumerating Roberts folder I found VPN

```rust
PS C:\users\Robert.Lanza\Desktop\VPN> ls


    Directory: C:\users\Robert.Lanza\Desktop\VPN


Mode                 LastWriteTime         Length Name                           
----                 -------------         ------ ----                           
-a----         2/18/2022   6:00 AM           2429 Inception_VPN_Robert_Lanza.ovpn
-a----         1/20/2021   1:12 AM           4037 otp.png                        


```

I am unable to download the opt file

```rust

otp.png NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM:(I)(F)
        BUILTIN\Administrators:(I)(F)
        inception\Robert.Lanza:(I)(F)

```

This did not lead to anything but lets keep enumerating this subnet
