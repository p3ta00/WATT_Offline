    Access Control System Documentation

    Introduction:
    This document provides a non-technical explanation of a simple access control system implemented in a programming language called Structured Text (ST). The system is designed to allow or deny access to a specific operation based on the input of a predefined password.

    Purpose:
    The purpose of this access control system is to ensure that only authorized users can perform a specific operation. It is a basic security measure used in various applications, from computer systems to industrial control systems.

    How It Works:
    1. Password Definition:
       - At the core of this system is a predefined password. In our example, the password is "password_here" (Note this is not a real password) You can customize this password to fit your needs.

    2. Enter Password Method:
       - The program includes a method called "EnterPassword." This method is responsible for verifying whether the entered password matches the predefined one.
       - If the entered password matches the predefined password, the method returns "TRUE," indicating that the password is correct. If they don't match, it returns "FALSE" to indicate an incorrect password.

    3. Enable Operation:
       - Another method called "EnableOperation" allows users to enable a specific operation.
       - If the operation is not already enabled, the user is prompted to enter a password.
       - The "PromptUserForPassword" function is used to obtain the user's input.
       - The "EnterPassword" method is then called to check if the entered password is correct.
       - If the password is correct, the operation is enabled. This might include granting access to a certain task or function.
       - The system allows only authorized users with the correct password to enable the operation.

    4. Disable Operation:
       - There is also a "DisableOperation" method to deactivate the operation. This can be performed by authorized users as well.

    Usage:
    The code serves as a basic template for implementing password-based access control in a structured text environment. You can modify the predefined password and adapt the code for your specific use case.

    Please note that in real-world applications, security is a crucial aspect. This simple code serves as a foundation for access control and can be expanded upon with additional security measures to protect sensitive data and operations.

    Customization:
    You can customize the password and integrate this code into your system to control access to specific functions or operations. The example provided is a starting point that can be extended to meet your security requirements.

    Security Note:
    In practice, real security systems require robust security practices and encryption methods to protect against unauthorized access. This code is a simplified demonstration and should not be used as a sole means of security in critical applications.
