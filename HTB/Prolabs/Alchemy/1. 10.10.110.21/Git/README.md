# Brewery Control Logic Repository

This internal Git repository serves as the central hub for managing and enhancing the Programmable Logic Controller (PLC) programs that automate our brewery's operations. Focused on the Structured Text (ST) programming language, this repository is designed to streamline our brewing processes, ensuring efficiency, precision, and consistency across all operations. 

## Purpose

Our goal is to foster an environment of continuous improvement and innovation within our brewing operations. By centralizing our PLC control logic in Structured Text, we can easily share, collaborate, and refine the systems that keep our brewery at the forefront of technology and quality. This initiative focuses on enhancing our control logic by developing a modular framework that incorporates reusable control blocks. The goal is to transition from our current legacy control logic to a more advanced, feature-rich system, ultimately elevating our operational capabilities and efficiency

## Repository Contents
